0,"Do not use sd card. Buy device with more storage. I found out what was wrong with my 7"" fire after I got this tablet. I got the 7"" to play my games on because I wanted to play on a bigger screen that is light. However, I had a problem within months of getting it & called customer service. The representative did screen sharing & although she couldn't exactly figure out the problem, she found a solution. Months later, though, I had the same problem, but was so ticked off about it that I didn't call for a long time. Finally called & as soon as I told rep about issue playing facebook games, he said to call facebook. Obviously rep is not familiar with facebook, because you can't call them. You message them on pc/app. I explained that I kept receiving an error message about an embedded browser, but the rep wouldn't screenshare to see what I was seeing & just wanted to get me off the phone & not try to solve my problem. After that, call, I worked on my facebook settings to see if I could get my games to work again & had initial success but had the problem again.  I mention all this because the same thing happened with the 8"", but this time I had clues from my 7"" issues to help me solve the problem. Initially I played my games without using a sd card, but I had problem when I put it in. I erased & reformatted it first & received a warning that it may slow things down. It did. My game was so slow that I took out the sd card. This took out all the games I had transferred, so I put the card back in and got the embedded browser error message. I tried a new sd card, same issue plus another issue I had had with my 7"". I kept get messages when I opened my tablet that the sd card was missing & it wouldn't let me use it till I 'reinserted' the sd card. The sd card was never missing, it was in the tablet the entire time, but i took it out then put it back in.  THAT was the PROBLEM the whole time, the SD CARD! I didn't play games on the 7"" till after I put in sd card. Since I played games on the 8"" before putting in sd card I knew the problem wasn't the facebook's, but Amazon's. The way the device is set up, it is finicky about the sd card. Device doesn't always recognize that the sd card is in & taking it out & putting it back in just causes problems with apps that were moved to it. The best option is to NOT USE SD CARD.  I took out the sd card, did a factory reset (I had just bought this & the only thing I had done on it was play games, so I didn't lose anything) then set it back up and enjoyed my games again. You CAN play facebook games on fire devices because they are on the app store, there is no problem with facebook, it's the sd card. My recommendation is that if you use a lot of apps on a tablet, buy the tablet with more storage. Using a sd card is more headache that it is worth. Also, I tried 2 different brands of sd card & same issue. I bought the 32GB tablet which does suit my needs.  Also, this device works fine. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the sd card issue. Do Not Use SD Card!  What really bums me out is that I finally figured out what the issue was on the 7"" fire, but only after I'd traded it for a bigger tablet. I thought that the issues I was having were because the 7"" wasn't as advanced as the 8"" which I thought was weird since I had an older 7"" that worked fine. The Amazon reps need new training to better help with Fire issues such as I had. I didn't appreciate being brushed off by the last rep I spoke with & if the reps did get better training, I would have still have the 7"" that I really wanted. On the plus side, due to Amazon's error/poor training, you now  know Not to get a sd card for your Fire.",,,,
1,"The extra RAM is essential but there are significant problems with the design Good: Inexpensive, high battery life, adequate performance, USB-C chargingBad:  Hard to hold, thick and heavy for screen size, unacceptable button placement, wireless charging turns device into echo show with ads - a feature I would pay to remove!I have owned three Fire HD 8 tablets and each generation has gotten more annoying to use because of compromises in the design intended to make them less expensive to produce.  I am extremely happy that Amazon has decided to market this upgraded version with 3 GB of RAM because that is now the minimum needed to run Android or Fire OS smoothly. The 1.5 that came with my second Fire HD8 never worked - it just isn't enough anymore, whereas the 2 GB that came with my first HD8  waa plenty for that era.  I think Amazon was foolish to make that change on the base HD8 because of the added frustration to the end user, but at least there is a choice to upgrade to this ""plus"" version with its frustration-free 3GB setup.  Is the experience as smooth or responsive as even the least expensive iPad?  Certainly not.  But those start at $400 and this was closer to $120.  What I really want is a $185 option that combines this specification or better with the physical design and form factor of earlier Fire HD8 generations, because when it comes to physical design this generation of Fire tablets is extremely annoying!  I am sure the changes are all designed to minimize cost but please find a better to do that than to put the power and volume buttons so close together with such a similar size and feel.  It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended ""touches"" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software",,,,
2,"Great tablet, wild operating system I do not mean ""Wild"" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections",,,,
3,"Wifi connection just ok, Libby added, WSJ app initial sign in problem This is my second HD8 Plus (2020) tablet and I use both mainly for reading newspapers and books.  Occasionally the wifi doesn't connect and I have to move closer to the router for the initial connection, which is maintained once connected when I return to the more remote location.  An earlier Fire 8 (2016) did not have the same connection problem in the same locations.  The Libby library app, which is not offered by the Amazon store but can be downloaded from another site, adds a significant dimension to the tablet.  I use Libby to borrow some books and read with the Amazon app.  An additional problem on the second tablet was getting the Amazon Wall Street Journal app - not the browser version via Silk - to accept my sign in  subscription credentials like it did easily for the first tablet. I contacted the WSJ for advice and tried a few of their tips, but none seems to work.  Then a few days later the sign in recognized my WSJ credentials and I was no longer denied access and subjected to the Amazon popup ad for the Amazon subscription.  I am still not sure why sign in  worked on my first tablet and not on the identical second - same system and app versions, too - and then eventually started to work on the second.  All is good now.",,,,
4,"Well, it's not an iPad... ...but it doesn't have to be one. Yes, I know, I'm comparing a $100+ device with one that at minimum costs several times more, but that's unavoidable. iPads are, after all, the gold standard of tablets, regardless of what those who stand firmly on the Android side of the fence think. Having said all of that, not everyone needs an iPad. For what it is, the Fire HD 8 Plus is a pretty decent device that will serve your content-consuming needs quite well for the price. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find any other Android-based tablet that even comes close to its functionality at the same price point.So, a bit about the specifics. This device runs Amazon's Fire OS, which is basically a reskinned version of Android, minus the Google apps that come on most Android-based devices. If this is an immediate turn-off, fear not - installing the Google apps is a relatively simple procedure that takes no more than a few minutes. Even disregarding them, this tablet offers a surprising amount of functionality for one of its price point. The Amazon App Store has a decent selection of apps available, although I've noticed that a few of them seem to not be updated as often as their counterparts through Google Play. Again, though, if this is an issue for anyone, it's easily fixed. Needless to say, app availability isn't going to be a problem for most people.Moving on, we have the specific focus of the device, which is consuming content, or more specifically, letting you line Lex Luthor's pockets. Fire OS is certain to take every opportunity available to shove content recommendations down your throat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for good stuff to read or watch. Fire OS includes a recommendations section at the top of the home screen that gives you recommendations based on your personal info and privacy that you signed away by using Amazon's ecosystem. For voracious readers, this can be a big boon, especially for those who like to discover new stuff to read. For others, it can be an annoyance, although really it's not so bad as it doesn't get in the way of anything.So, let's talk about the hardware real quick. The overall design of this device is decent, especially considering the low price. The casing is all plastic, yet not overly cheap feeling. In fact, it feels surprisingly rugged yet is quite light, meaning that you won't be straining your hand or tiring your arm during long reading sessions. The 8-inch screen seems to be the perfect size for reading ebooks. In fact, I much prefer it to the 10-inch model for this very purpose, as the latter seems to be a bit too unwieldy for my tastes. The screen quality, while nothing to write home about, is quite sufficient and doesn't detract from the quality of your time spent using the device. Still though, unless you're a stickler for color content, those who prefer reading bog-standard books may prefer a Kindle or other e-ink based device. But really, that's all just a matter of personal preference.The internals of this tablet are decent, again, for its price point. The key here, though, is the price point. You're not going to get an extremely powerful device for just over $100, so don't expect this tablet to expand your productivity options or to give you a riveting gaming experience. As an example of the latter, you won't be able to run Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal on this device, as the hardware just isn't up to the task. For lighter games, though, it'll work fine. Just don't expect miracles.Overall, there's more I could nitpick here, such as the typical laggy experience that cheaper devices suffer from when burdened by an Android-based OS, but I think most people can live with such things when it comes to low-end hardware. For what the Fire HD 8 plus promises, you'll get a pretty decent content-consuming experience.",,,,
5,"Calling all manufacturers We need to start making more devices for people who need a more tactile experience...possible a few with the feel of a brick, or slab of concrete. Maybe like he bottom of my skid free Pumas. Possibly with goosebumps, suede, or fuzzy loose and wrinkled like the neck of a cat. In any event the slip factor feels like an Omen or something...I have to pray it every time it falls, drops or slides out of my hands that this is the end of its functionality, the beginning of trying to live with a few chips, cracked screen or other unpleasant eyesore after it collides with the mosaic tiles or metal stairway. All the devices designed like to this are very haphazard. Outter box not included.",,,,
6,,"The Perfect Budget E-Reader! I purchased this device looking for a way to read my kindle library and DMR free PDF books. I know the most would purchase a Kindle e-reader instead, but at the time of my purchase the cheapest Kindle available was $100, was only in black in white (I have many full color comics so that wasn't ideal) and had a 6"" screen. This tablet of course is in color, has an 8"" screen, and was on sale from amazon warehouse for $70. So why pay more for less. Despite being used the tablet showed up in great condition and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",,,
7,,"A great update to the Fire tablet line This Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus is a great complementary device for those who already have a real computer.  This is true whether that real computer is a desktop or a laptop.  Windows 10 or Mac Os, it doesn't matter.  As long as you have a ""real"" computer, this Fire HD 8 Plus table is a great companion device.  Perhaps the best companion device for most people.I work in the IT field.  In my opinion, most people overbuy and overspend on technology devices.  Which is fine, buying that new toy can be fun.  For a while.  But know this.  A lot of you what buy, you can do without.  Let me explain.  A computing device like a desktop or a laptop gives you the most versatility.  Add a smart phone and those are all the tech needed by the majority of people.  Most do not need a writing tablet to draw on or take notes on.  Most just need a secondary device for portability and quick access.  A Fire tablet will do that.I own a Windows 10 and a Macbook laptops.  I also own an iPad.  Occasionally, I would use my Kindle reader and my old Fire HDX 7.  I only need three to meet all of my needs.  One laptop, my smart phone, and a tablet.  I only use the ipad to pick fights on Twitter, make quick purchases on Amazon, and check my email.  I may go on Facebook once in a while.  Guess what.  Any Windows 10 or Macbook would do those and with more versatility.  My smart phone would do all of those, although with a lot less versatility and more aggravation.  An Amazon Fire tablet will do all of those things, with more finesse and ease than a smart phone.  And just as well as an iPad.I bought this new Fire to replace a 2015 Fire HDX 7.  The HDX 7 is still in perfect shape.  The battery holds as much charge as when it was new.  But it no longer runs the Amazon shopping app.  That's the only thing wrong with it.  My Kindle is also of 2015 vintage.  That Kindle is also still in perfect condition.  But this newer model has updates that I wanted.  Like front and rear facing cameras.  The HDX 7 only has a front facing camera.  I wanted to run the Amazon shopping app, for ease of use.  I also wanted to start a relationship with the charming Alexa.  It doesn't mean I'm dumping Sirri though.I can readily recommend this Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus for most people who already have a true computer, whether it's Windows or Mac.  This is a great companion device for those who already have a computer.  It is a lot less expensive than an iPad and does almost as much.  It is also a lot more durable.  Most tablets are used for media consumption and social interactions.  You can do those on this Fire.  The only thing you might miss is a browser like Safari or Edge.  Silk works fine and it has gotten better over the years, but I still prefer a traditional browser.I did not order the wireless dock.  This Fire will be carried with me to work.  Charging with the USB is fine for now.  I bought the Amazon protective sleeve that was made for this device.  You want to keep your Fire in some kind of a protective sleeve so the screen does not get scratched.When you buy tech toys, find the sweet spot.  Always buy something that can be upgraded.  I have added more RAM as well as upgraded the hard drive to solid state on my 5-year-old Windows 10 laptop.  It still runs great after five years.  It is a high-end Lenovo model.  Likewise, I bought the Fire HD 8 Plus because you can add additional storage easily.  You cannot really upgrade an iPad.  I am not saying buy high end, but pay more up front and keep the device for a lot longer.This Fire HD 8 Plus is a fine device.  No, it will not meet the needs of the artists who wants to use a pen/stylus to draw.  It will not meet the requirements of the busy college student who wants to take precise notes by hand on a tablet.  But it will capably do email, twitter, facebook, Amazon purchases, take pictures, make videos, ebooks, audiobooks, just fine.  The Silk browser has gotten better and works well.",,,
8,,"Replaced my HD 10s I won't go into all of the technical aspects since those have been done to death (but perfectly) in many of the other reviews.I ordered this as a package with the wireless charger stand that converts it into an Alexa device when mated.  The package arrived within the two day Prime shipping time, so I guess the CV19 is having less of an effect on Amazon shipping as time passes.I actually had 2 Fire HD 10 tablets for complicated reasons that probably don't really fit the story.  I loved almost every aspect of the 10-inch tablet except the size when I was trying to read in bed.  It is just too big and awkward to comfortably hold.I quickly opened everything and powered up the tablet and started what I thought would be the normal configuration procedure.  Almost everything was the same as with the other two tablets I had with the exception of the annoying animated video you have to sit through that explains the different functions and benefits of the Fire tablets.  There really should be an option that allows the animation to be skipped, especially for repeat owners.  During the configuration process, the tablet does download the latest updates to the operating system.  Since I previously had a Fire tablet that I had deregistered, the configuration process gave me the option to download all of the apps, settings, etc. from that tablet.  The odd thing was that since I had two tablets it only gave me the option to sync the information from the tablet I had deregistered and performed a factory reset on over a week ago and not the tablet I had just deregistered yesterday.  Other than that, everything went very smoothly.After that process was complete, I went into YouTube and watched a video that I would recommend everyone with any of the Fire tablets should watch on Tips & Tricks for the Fire HD 8.  It is a short video and gives instructions on several settings changes that are very beneficial and do not affect the warranty or stability of the tablet.After getting everything configured to suit me I went to the Amazon APP store and downloaded a few more things that didn't transfer over from syncing the to the settings on one of my previous tablets.Amazon may censor this comment, but I also sideloaded the Google Playstore so I could download several other apps that were critical to me.After all that was completed, I was pleasantly surprised that several minor changes had been made to the user interface and other functions that are great improvements.  They are so subtle that most casual users may not even notice but I appreciate the upgrades.The tablet is very snappy and the apps all execute very quickly.  The screen resolution is lower than the 10-inch tablets but since the screen is smaller I cannot discern any difference in viewing quality of icons, photos, or video.  The placement of the stereo speakers is better than the 10-inch tablet but since the device is so small there probably isn't much benefit.  I did connect to my Bluetooth earbuds and watch part of a movie and the sound quality and stereo sound stage are excellent.The other improvements aside, the bottom line is that the form factor of the 8-inch table suits my needs much better.  This thing is very comfortable to hold and is still large enough to provide extremely good viewing quality at a fraction of the cost of Samsung and Apple tablets.  I have owned a couple of Samsung tablets and a Sony Xperia tablet in the past and for the most part, they are great tablets but are really overkill for the typical user.When you decide you need a tablet make sure you make an accurate assessment of your actual needs and don't buy something that is bigger or more than what you really need.Now...go read the in-depth technical writeups from other reviewers and more importantly watch several of the YouTube videos that demonstrate both the Fire HD 8 and HD 8 Plus to make sure they are right for you.",,,
9,,My Third Kindle I replaced a kindle that I have been using for at least a dozen years.  This one is the best yet!  Screen resolution is wonderful.

It is far too easy to press the power button to begin with because it protrudes to far from the case and doesn't have a very strong spring, but when you put it right next to an identical feeling volume button that is just unacceptable!  There is good reason why almost every phone and tablet in the world has these buttons in different locations ( often opposite sides or ends of the phone.)I happen to believe that it probably would work to have both buttons on the same end as the charger and headphone jack but not if you put them this close together, and give them exactly the same tactile feel and the same overly light spring rate. Please at least recess the power button, use a different surface texture and a stiffer spring. Or better yet move it to the opposite corner where the headphone Jack is now.And for users with the current, unfortunate design you could eliminate the worst effects with a software update. Just modify the software to require a longer press of the power key before it shuts down the display.  If a one-second press were required then it would eliminate 90% of the instances when I have accidentally shut down the screen trying n to change the volume.  With no security options other than a pass code, tis means I almost every time I try to adjust the volume while listening to a podcast or watching a video I have that experience interupted and I end up having to enter my pass code and physically restart what I was listening to just because I tried to adjust the volume.  This design choice just doesn't work.  Fix it, Amazon!Another cost saving design choice is that Amazon has allowed the HD8 tablets to get thicker each generation, which I agree is probably reasonable.  But between the thicker body and the much smaller bezel compared to previous generations, I am finding this version much more difficult to hold.  I actually think the sensitivity of the screen might also be a factor because if I put fingers on the front edge if the glass at all this registers as a touch. So to prevent that my fingers must stay on the plastic, and there just isn't enough plastic on the front bit the tablet to get a good grip.  That gives the impression of the tablet being heavier and more awkward than it probably is.  And again this could be an issue that might be addressed with software if the screen sensitivity could be decreased a bit to reject unintended ""touches"" at the edges ( in this case beyond the edges). of the screen.My final gripe is going to be about the behavior of the device when put on a wireless charger.  Oddly, when I want to use a wireless charger my intention is to actually charge the device.  It is not to turn my tablet, for which I paid extra to have ads removed from the lock screen into an always on Echo Show with advertising!I'm sure there are some people who might actually use an Echo Show and for them this must feel like an amazing value.  Like getting a second device for free.  But I just want it gone.  I would never willingly use, much less purchase, an Echo Show, particularly one with a working camera, because I can't accept the privacy and security risk. And I certainly don't want another device showering.me with advertising.That said, I don't object at all into Amazon including the Echo Show functionality with the tablet, or even having it run by default when you connect it to a wireless charger, but there needs to be clear documentation about how to control this feature and how to turn it off both permanently and temporarily.  Without that I am actually losing two features I specifically paid for on this tablet, wireless charging and freedom from advertising.  Please do a much better job explaining this feature and how to control it as you update the device software",,,,
2,"Great tablet, wild operating system I do not mean ""Wild"" kindly, but I'll get to that shortly. Sorry for the long read, but I have a lot of thoughts about this particular product to inform you, the end-user of your purchasing decision before you commit a purchase, and as a responsible citizen of the Internet, I've heavily tested the tablet hands-on to see what I can make it do, how I can make it work and where Amazon's hires could improve the overall experience for a multi-adult household.The tablet itself is functional. What else is there to say about it? Inside a home or building, so long the sun isn't shining directly on it the display is bright, with a clear, crisp display and along with a decent battery much bigger than your current handheld mobile device, you also get anywhere between a mediocre and acceptable tablet use experience, depending on how much money you hand to Amazon. I painfully regret not going with the Fire HD 10, but I am a bit of a cheapskate and after having seen what comes with the Fire HD Kids' Pro 8 through an encounter with a daughter of my mother's friend, I figured the Fire HD 8 Plus would be the same exact experience — and I can happily say, it is.The inclusion of a three-pole phone socket for headphones and TF / micro SD slot for extra storage practically makes it the ideal tablet computer… until you try to use it as a multi-user tablet computer. But we'll get to those gripes later. First impressions of the hardware makes it seem like the absolute perfect device for personal and work use, domestic and abroad. A simple tablet with great features. Except for a GSM / SIM slot but if you already have a mobile handheld, the Fire can use wireless tethering whenever the tablet needs access to the Internet where WiFi isn't available, and it can do calls via WiFi so that's something if your friends aren't using any of the supported social network platforms available through Amazon's app market.Fire OS on the other hand, that's uhm — fun. Yes, fun. If you receive nothing else from this, should you be the sole adult of the tablet, then you have nothing to worry about. Everything just works — for you. For anyone else? Yeah, nah. Show mode is honestly a great inclusion, as well Alexa Hands-Free — it's like if you have a general-purpose tablet, Amazon Show desktop unit and phone (which can only do calls via WiFi) for what was at the time of Prime Day anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars depending on device capabilities. What a bargain!…For the primary user. Second adult? Nah, can't do Show Mode, Alexa Hands-Free or WiFi calling. But children can do calls with approved contacts and permission from their parents! That hardly makes any sense — if you're not a child you don't get to make calls beyond the primary profile? Why? Speaking of kids, if you think that kids' launcher or adult settings will let you move off all of the kids' apps to an SD card, ha ha nope. So your child will very likely make using the tablet almost impossible after they stuff the internal storage with nothing but pointless games.For a couple, it makes even less sense to buy this for the intent of using voice recognition features. Sure, auto guy and shop girl can keep their profiles separate, but only one of them get the privilege of using all of the tablet's features. A second adult profile is like a grown-up kid, and feels almost demeaning, which likely means whoever wears the pants between two people will be the one with the primary account which does everything. And what if they want to share applications? There's no easy way to do this beyond reinstalling them on the other profile. I've looked, and there seems to be no way of easily sharing apps between adult profiles which especially makes installation of such things as Google Play a major drag without third-party guidance and tools.It's an Amazon device, so of course it will advertise Amazon everything — even Washington Post. If you don't use that service, too bad can't disable. If you don't care about Amazon's other services, too bad shove it in a folder on the Fire Launcher. Without tinkering beyond what Amazon allows you to do, it kind of makes using the tablet a terrible experience being inundated with all of these Amazon-owned things at once, and for some people the constant upselling is enough to warrant a return.If you can get over all of that — and again, if you are the sole adult of the tablet, none of the above save for the upsells are really an issue — then you have yourself a capable and handy little Android-based tablet which will do almost everything you want. A solid product with a mediocre and terribly flawed OS, but one if you've committed your entire life to Amazon may be welcome. As I exhibit no such brand loyalty I'm exceedingly annoyed, but all of the thorns and papercuts are nothing a little bit of tinkering cannot cleave and become rid of.EDIT 07/06/21.1: Minor correction, seems like while four-pole may fit, I can't use external mic with the tablet or Fire OS doesn't disclose how to do this.EDIT 07/06/21.2: Grammar and error corrections",,,,
3,"Wifi connection just ok, Libby added, WSJ app initial sign in problem This is my second HD8 Plus (2020) tablet and I use both mainly for reading newspapers and books.  Occasionally the wifi doesn't connect and I have to move closer to the router for the initial connection, which is maintained once connected when I return to the more remote location.  An earlier Fire 8 (2016) did not have the same connection problem in the same locations.  The Libby library app, which is not offered by the Amazon store but can be downloaded from another site, adds a significant dimension to the tablet.  I use Libby to borrow some books and read with the Amazon app.  An additional problem on the second tablet was getting the Amazon Wall Street Journal app - not the browser version via Silk - to accept my sign in  subscription credentials like it did easily for the first tablet. I contacted the WSJ for advice and tried a few of their tips, but none seems to work.  Then a few days later the sign in recognized my WSJ credentials and I was no longer denied access and subjected to the Amazon popup ad for the Amazon subscription.  I am still not sure why sign in  worked on my first tablet and not on the identical second - same system and app versions, too - and then eventually started to work on the second.  All is good now.",,,,
4,"Well, it's not an iPad... ...but it doesn't have to be one. Yes, I know, I'm comparing a $100+ device with one that at minimum costs several times more, but that's unavoidable. iPads are, after all, the gold standard of tablets, regardless of what those who stand firmly on the Android side of the fence think. Having said all of that, not everyone needs an iPad. For what it is, the Fire HD 8 Plus is a pretty decent device that will serve your content-consuming needs quite well for the price. In fact, you'll be hard-pressed to find any other Android-based tablet that even comes close to its functionality at the same price point.So, a bit about the specifics. This device runs Amazon's Fire OS, which is basically a reskinned version of Android, minus the Google apps that come on most Android-based devices. If this is an immediate turn-off, fear not - installing the Google apps is a relatively simple procedure that takes no more than a few minutes. Even disregarding them, this tablet offers a surprising amount of functionality for one of its price point. The Amazon App Store has a decent selection of apps available, although I've noticed that a few of them seem to not be updated as often as their counterparts through Google Play. Again, though, if this is an issue for anyone, it's easily fixed. Needless to say, app availability isn't going to be a problem for most people.Moving on, we have the specific focus of the device, which is consuming content, or more specifically, letting you line Lex Luthor's pockets. Fire OS is certain to take every opportunity available to shove content recommendations down your throat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're looking for good stuff to read or watch. Fire OS includes a recommendations section at the top of the home screen that gives you recommendations based on your personal info and privacy that you signed away by using Amazon's ecosystem. For voracious readers, this can be a big boon, especially for those who like to discover new stuff to read. For others, it can be an annoyance, although really it's not so bad as it doesn't get in the way of anything.So, let's talk about the hardware real quick. The overall design of this device is decent, especially considering the low price. The casing is all plastic, yet not overly cheap feeling. In fact, it feels surprisingly rugged yet is quite light, meaning that you won't be straining your hand or tiring your arm during long reading sessions. The 8-inch screen seems to be the perfect size for reading ebooks. In fact, I much prefer it to the 10-inch model for this very purpose, as the latter seems to be a bit too unwieldy for my tastes. The screen quality, while nothing to write home about, is quite sufficient and doesn't detract from the quality of your time spent using the device. Still though, unless you're a stickler for color content, those who prefer reading bog-standard books may prefer a Kindle or other e-ink based device. But really, that's all just a matter of personal preference.The internals of this tablet are decent, again, for its price point. The key here, though, is the price point. You're not going to get an extremely powerful device for just over $100, so don't expect this tablet to expand your productivity options or to give you a riveting gaming experience. As an example of the latter, you won't be able to run Genshin Impact or Diablo Immortal on this device, as the hardware just isn't up to the task. For lighter games, though, it'll work fine. Just don't expect miracles.Overall, there's more I could nitpick here, such as the typical laggy experience that cheaper devices suffer from when burdened by an Android-based OS, but I think most people can live with such things when it comes to low-end hardware. For what the Fire HD 8 plus promises, you'll get a pretty decent content-consuming experience.",,,,
5,"Calling all manufacturers We need to start making more devices for people who need a more tactile experience...possible a few with the feel of a brick, or slab of concrete. Maybe like he bottom of my skid free Pumas. Possibly with goosebumps, suede, or fuzzy loose and wrinkled like the neck of a cat. In any event the slip factor feels like an Omen or something...I have to pray it every time it falls, drops or slides out of my hands that this is the end of its functionality, the beginning of trying to live with a few chips, cracked screen or other unpleasant eyesore after it collides with the mosaic tiles or metal stairway. All the devices designed like to this are very haphazard. Outter box not included.",,,,
6,,"The Perfect Budget E-Reader! I purchased this device looking for a way to read my kindle library and DMR free PDF books. I know the most would purchase a Kindle e-reader instead, but at the time of my purchase the cheapest Kindle available was $100, was only in black in white (I have many full color comics so that wasn't ideal) and had a 6"" screen. This tablet of course is in color, has an 8"" screen, and was on sale from amazon warehouse for $70. So why pay more for less. Despite being used the tablet showed up in great condition and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",,,
7,,"A great update to the Fire tablet line This Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus is a great complementary device for those who already have a real computer.  This is true whether that real computer is a desktop or a laptop.  Windows 10 or Mac Os, it doesn't matter.  As long as you have a ""real"" computer, this Fire HD 8 Plus table is a great companion device.  Perhaps the best companion device for most people.I work in the IT field.  In my opinion, most people overbuy and overspend on technology devices.  Which is fine, buying that new toy can be fun.  For a while.  But know this.  A lot of you what buy, you can do without.  Let me explain.  A computing device like a desktop or a laptop gives you the most versatility.  Add a smart phone and those are all the tech needed by the majority of people.  Most do not need a writing tablet to draw on or take notes on.  Most just need a secondary device for portability and quick access.  A Fire tablet will do that.I own a Windows 10 and a Macbook laptops.  I also own an iPad.  Occasionally, I would use my Kindle reader and my old Fire HDX 7.  I only need three to meet all of my needs.  One laptop, my smart phone, and a tablet.  I only use the ipad to pick fights on Twitter, make quick purchases on Amazon, and check my email.  I may go on Facebook once in a while.  Guess what.  Any Windows 10 or Macbook would do those and with more versatility.  My smart phone would do all of those, although with a lot less versatility and more aggravation.  An Amazon Fire tablet will do all of those things, with more finesse and ease than a smart phone.  And just as well as an iPad.I bought this new Fire to replace a 2015 Fire HDX 7.  The HDX 7 is still in perfect shape.  The battery holds as much charge as when it was new.  But it no longer runs the Amazon shopping app.  That's the only thing wrong with it.  My Kindle is also of 2015 vintage.  That Kindle is also still in perfect condition.  But this newer model has updates that I wanted.  Like front and rear facing cameras.  The HDX 7 only has a front facing camera.  I wanted to run the Amazon shopping app, for ease of use.  I also wanted to start a relationship with the charming Alexa.  It doesn't mean I'm dumping Sirri though.I can readily recommend this Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus for most people who already have a true computer, whether it's Windows or Mac.  This is a great companion device for those who already have a computer.  It is a lot less expensive than an iPad and does almost as much.  It is also a lot more durable.  Most tablets are used for media consumption and social interactions.  You can do those on this Fire.  The only thing you might miss is a browser like Safari or Edge.  Silk works fine and it has gotten better over the years, but I still prefer a traditional browser.I did not order the wireless dock.  This Fire will be carried with me to work.  Charging with the USB is fine for now.  I bought the Amazon protective sleeve that was made for this device.  You want to keep your Fire in some kind of a protective sleeve so the screen does not get scratched.When you buy tech toys, find the sweet spot.  Always buy something that can be upgraded.  I have added more RAM as well as upgraded the hard drive to solid state on my 5-year-old Windows 10 laptop.  It still runs great after five years.  It is a high-end Lenovo model.  Likewise, I bought the Fire HD 8 Plus because you can add additional storage easily.  You cannot really upgrade an iPad.  I am not saying buy high end, but pay more up front and keep the device for a lot longer.This Fire HD 8 Plus is a fine device.  No, it will not meet the needs of the artists who wants to use a pen/stylus to draw.  It will not meet the requirements of the busy college student who wants to take precise notes by hand on a tablet.  But it will capably do email, twitter, facebook, Amazon purchases, take pictures, make videos, ebooks, audiobooks, just fine.  The Silk browser has gotten better and works well.",,,
8,,"Replaced my HD 10s I won't go into all of the technical aspects since those have been done to death (but perfectly) in many of the other reviews.I ordered this as a package with the wireless charger stand that converts it into an Alexa device when mated.  The package arrived within the two day Prime shipping time, so I guess the CV19 is having less of an effect on Amazon shipping as time passes.I actually had 2 Fire HD 10 tablets for complicated reasons that probably don't really fit the story.  I loved almost every aspect of the 10-inch tablet except the size when I was trying to read in bed.  It is just too big and awkward to comfortably hold.I quickly opened everything and powered up the tablet and started what I thought would be the normal configuration procedure.  Almost everything was the same as with the other two tablets I had with the exception of the annoying animated video you have to sit through that explains the different functions and benefits of the Fire tablets.  There really should be an option that allows the animation to be skipped, especially for repeat owners.  During the configuration process, the tablet does download the latest updates to the operating system.  Since I previously had a Fire tablet that I had deregistered, the configuration process gave me the option to download all of the apps, settings, etc. from that tablet.  The odd thing was that since I had two tablets it only gave me the option to sync the information from the tablet I had deregistered and performed a factory reset on over a week ago and not the tablet I had just deregistered yesterday.  Other than that, everything went very smoothly.After that process was complete, I went into YouTube and watched a video that I would recommend everyone with any of the Fire tablets should watch on Tips & Tricks for the Fire HD 8.  It is a short video and gives instructions on several settings changes that are very beneficial and do not affect the warranty or stability of the tablet.After getting everything configured to suit me I went to the Amazon APP store and downloaded a few more things that didn't transfer over from syncing the to the settings on one of my previous tablets.Amazon may censor this comment, but I also sideloaded the Google Playstore so I could download several other apps that were critical to me.After all that was completed, I was pleasantly surprised that several minor changes had been made to the user interface and other functions that are great improvements.  They are so subtle that most casual users may not even notice but I appreciate the upgrades.The tablet is very snappy and the apps all execute very quickly.  The screen resolution is lower than the 10-inch tablets but since the screen is smaller I cannot discern any difference in viewing quality of icons, photos, or video.  The placement of the stereo speakers is better than the 10-inch tablet but since the device is so small there probably isn't much benefit.  I did connect to my Bluetooth earbuds and watch part of a movie and the sound quality and stereo sound stage are excellent.The other improvements aside, the bottom line is that the form factor of the 8-inch table suits my needs much better.  This thing is very comfortable to hold and is still large enough to provide extremely good viewing quality at a fraction of the cost of Samsung and Apple tablets.  I have owned a couple of Samsung tablets and a Sony Xperia tablet in the past and for the most part, they are great tablets but are really overkill for the typical user.When you decide you need a tablet make sure you make an accurate assessment of your actual needs and don't buy something that is bigger or more than what you really need.Now...go read the in-depth technical writeups from other reviewers and more importantly watch several of the YouTube videos that demonstrate both the Fire HD 8 and HD 8 Plus to make sure they are right for you.",,,
9,,My Third Kindle I replaced a kindle that I have been using for at least a dozen years.  This one is the best yet!  Screen resolution is wonderful.

1,"Fire Tablet vs Kindle I already have the HD 10 and wanted to have a smaller device just for reading. This one fits nicely in my palm. I almost bought a kindle since it's specifically built for reading. But I chose HD 8 Plus instead, because it can show Pdf and some other materials that can't be accommodated in kindle.HD 8 plus is obviously not as fast as my HD 10. It's pretty slow, I must add. I don't install too much application since I just want to have it mostly for reading. I also put antiglare for better reading experiences, and a nice cover. Another downside is that this has pretty short battery life (around 8 hours of use). Compare to kindle that lasts for weeks. One thing I can do to extend the battery life is I change to airplane mode, which significantly increase the life.",,,,
2,"PRETTY GOOD; HERE'S HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER The Amazon Fire HD 8 is designed for happy Amazon customers who don’t mind being restricted to the Amazon ecosystem.  You can stream Amazon media, read Amazon books, buy stuff from Amazon, and download Amazon-approved apps from the Amazon app store.  Did you notice all the “Amazons” in those two sentences?  That’s a pretty good summary of the Fire experience, until you tweak it.To be fair, all the major apps are available – Netflix/HBO/Disney etc., MS Office/Zoom/Skype etc., most of the civilization-destroying social media apps, and thousands of those dumb little dinky doodle games.What’s NOT available is almost everything I want on my tablet, with Firefox and DuckDuckGo browsers at the top of the  list.  Fortunately, a little tweaking leads straight to the pot of gold – Google Play Store, which opens up the entire Google ecosystem.  Search “install google play store on amazon fire hd,” to learn how.Once Google Play Store is installed, it’s a vastly better device.  You get almost everything Google offers (some of it is incompatible with Fire), and you can take your pick of web browsers.It’s still a low-end tablet, but if you get it on promotion it’s an outstanding value.  I paid $50, plus $15 for the no-ads upgrade (I’ve seen those lock screen ads, they’re SUPER ANNOYING), plus $35 for 64 GB internal storage.  I traded in a dying Samsung tablet and got $20 off, and a $5 gift card.  I got me a darn good tablet for just $80.My only real beef is that it doesn’t support casting.  Apparently older models did, so what’s up with that, Amazon?  My best guess is that casting competes with the Fire TV stick.  This is the only reason it gets four stars instead of five.So out of the box, it gets three stars.  Tweak it with Google Play Store, and it moves up to four.  It would be five stars with casting.  For me, it’s primarily a travel device:  a larger screen than my phone for web browsing, plus movies and streaming video.  I just wish Amazon would lighten up and make it easy to install Google Play Store – and of course restore casting.Pros:• PRICE!!!  (especially on sale)• 58 bazillion apps, once you install Google Play Store• Excellent video, and decent sound.  Bluetooth earbuds sound great• MicroSD slot, for all my movies• Good battery life• Wireless chargingCons:• DOESN’T CAST!• Far fewer apps in the Amazon app store, and many of those are Amazon-modified.  No web browsers at all, which brings me to –• Silk Browser stinks – it's slow, the whole design is awkward, and it has very limited features (especially privacy, huge surprise)• Dumb feature – if it’s asleep, the ONLY way to wake it up is to find and press the tiny little power button.  Hey Amazon – how about “any button wakes device,” or even better, “tap screen twice wakes device”?• You can't uninstall unwanted Amazon Apps, and you can't remove ANY app shortcuts from your home screen.  I created a home screen folder called ""Amazon Crap"" – guess what's in it.• Installing Google Play Store is a little tricky – google it to learn how• Connecting to your PC for USB data transfer is a little tricky – google it to learn how",,,,
3,,"An affordable quality tablet with respectable features I am a fan of Amazon's tablet offerings and have been for years. I do also have iPads, which I use for music related apps. but for everyday uses the Fire HD tablets are a very smart option.What I like:1. Price - you get a lot of computer for relatively little money2. Screen & Speakers - Amazon has improved the resolution and brightness of their tablet screens over the last few years that rival Apple, Samsung, etc. Movie audio is crisp and loud enough, even streaming music isn't bad on the built-in stereo speakers3. Battery - on the 8"" and 10"" Fire HD tablets you will get impressive battery life, especially if you take the effort to power off if you won't be using it for a few days. The 7"" tablet does not have quite the same battery life however, from my experience4. Everyday uses - Amazon's browser, email, office, games, entertainment, audio books, music, etc integrated apps are well thought out and work intuitively and efficiently on these tablets.5. Entertainment and shopping - if you're a Prime member the Fire HD tablet is really a no-brainer, especially if you watch Prime or other prescription streaming video or do any amount of shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods6. Alexa and Smart devices - the Fire HD tablets easily work together with your home Smart devices, such as Ring doorbells and security detectors and are quite versatile too. You can sync them with your Echo devices, TVs, security video cameras, etc. You can even use them to communicate with other Fire tablets in your home - almost like a video intercom system7. Updates - Amazon is always improving the functionality of their devices so new features often appear with OS updates. Basically you're getting more than you paid for over time.What I don't like so much:1. Fire OS - Amazon has done a great job with their operating system but still has some work to do as far as multi-tasking, efficiency and compatibility with certain file protocols. Also the internal filing system and access to the SD card for storage is a little clunky. Transferring files from one device to another can be confusing2. Camera integration - the Fire HD tablets have decent cameras (well, the front one is decent) but they don't seem to play that well with the included photo app - and the filing system apart from Amazon Cloud is again, somewhat non-intuitive. This is something that obviously can be remedied with software updates, hopefully soon.3. 3rd party applications - Amazon is pretty strict about which apps can be used with the Fire OS (you cannot download from GooglePlay) so there are likely a few apps you like that will be unavailable - unless you hack the tablet to run as a straight-up Android device, which defeats the purpose of having an Amazon device in the first place. So..That pretty much covers it from my perspective. The Fire HD 8"" & 10"" are a real bargain in the Android-ish tablet market, IMHO. I really love mine and use them daily and believe you will love yours too!",,,
4,,"Good little unit. I loved the price of this little tablet.....I just hope Amazon keeps supporting and updating the software from 2020.  It is great if you have to buy an affordable tablet for your kids for school, at 59.00 brand new....I am very happy with it.",,,

 So much has already been said about the Fire HD 8 Plus, but I was really trying to decide between the Fire HD 8 Plus and the Echo Show 8, and I couldn't find a very comprehensive overview of the difference, so I decided to try out both to see the difference.First, the screens are virtually identical in size and shape. Side-by-side, when the screens are off, it's somewhat hard to tell which one is the Fire and which one is the show. The most telling difference is the placement of the camera, which is top and center of the Fire and top and right on the Show (more on the cameras later). The screen specs are the same (8” high-definition touchscreen; 1280 x 800 resolution), but the Echo screen is considerably brighter. I wouldn't notice if they weren't side-by-side, but it's a marked difference (see photo). The Show also has more customizable wallpaper options. On the show, you can select from a number of different wallpaper options, but on the Fire, you an only customize by selecting your own photos. This may not be an issue for many, but it's one more small perk of the Show.The camera on the Fire is considerably better (2 MP vs 1 MP on the Show), but for the purposes of dropping in on another Echo device, that is pretty minor. Certainly for the purpose of using it as a tablet, this is better, but I suspect most people will have a cell phone with a better camera than that, so I don't see the 2 MP camera being a deal-breaker for most people. The placement of the camera on the Echo is a bit awkward as it is to the right of the screen, so when you're looking at the screen, it always looks a little like you're looking to the left. If you are getting this device for the purpose of having regular phone conferences, that could be a deal-maker for the Fire. However, for me, one major win that the Show has over the Fire is the physical privacy shutter. You can close it and even if someone could hack into the Show, they could still not see you because there is a physical piece of plastic in the way. This is especially comforting if you are going to have this in a bedroom or somewhere else where privacy is especially important.By far, the biggest difference for me in these two is the sound quality. As some have said, the sound on the Fire is worse than most cell phones, and much worse than any speaker on the Echo line. And, in the opposite direction, the Echo Show speaker is spectacular. The volume is extraordinarily loud (to the point where, if it is on full volume, it actually hurts my ears to listen to). The attached video shows the difference in volume. The first few seconds are of the Fire at full volume, and then it switches over to the Show, and then back. On a different song, the max dB reading for the Fire was 67.1 dB, whereas the max for the show was 89.5 dB. The bass on the Show is substantial, and the overall quality, though not the best speaker you will ever hear, far outstrips the quality and volume of the Fire.There are a few other differences that are possibly somewhat minor to some. For example, Spotify is not native to the Fire Show screen, so if you want to play music on Spotify, it will switch you to the Fire OS, where you will have to install Spotify and play from there. Not a big deal, but it's somewhat nice that Spotify comes out of the box for the Show. There are other similar things, and I haven't explored them all, but it is to say that the Fire version of an Echo Show is not 1:1 of the actual Echo Show.As far as the tablet itself, again, this has been reviewed somewhat exhaustively, but I'll say (as many others have) that it pales in comparison to a higher-end tablet such as an iPad. I got my iPad 7 for $250 new at Best Buy, so for a little over double the price, I was able to get 10x the performance over the Fire HD 8 Plus and double the screen size. There are definitely things to like about the Fire, and for a budget e-reader/video streamer/audiobook player, then this could be a great deal for you. But, then again, you could get all of that from the Fire 7 for half the price. It's all about your priorities and your budget, but the wireless charging and more RAM didn't win me over enough to justify this tablet in my arsenal of screens. It might for you, though.Bottom line, if you are looking for a Fire tablet that also works as an Echo, this may be what you're looking for. It is a nice enough tablet (if you know what you're getting into), and it definitely functions as an Echo to do things like turn on smart home devices and tell you the weather. However, if you are looking for an Echo that is also a tablet (as I was), I highly recommend going with the Echo Show 8 instead. There are a lot of other good tablet options out there, and the speaker difference alone gives the Show much more value in my opinion.",,

 Here's my quick review on the Amazon Tablet 8. First off I ordered this tablet and it didn't ship until a day before I was expecting to get it which is today December 28th. Plus I already have Amazon Prime so I don't understand why it took so long to ship my order. Amazon always knocks on the door one time and just leaves your package where it's at so it's important to always keep a look out when tracking your package on Amazon and always be close to your door. So far the tablet is working good. I recorded a little video playing subway surfers just to test it out and it was working fine. I'm only gonna use this tablet for gaming so I just ordered a SD card for it so I can use more storage. I have no complaints about the tablet itself my only complaint is the shipping taking long.",,,
4,"OK overall... For the price, this tablet is great. However; it is not an android tablet. Meaning I can't access any of my Google accounts or apps like sheets or docs, and for certain services it's not a supported device. Fire is Amazon's software. There needs to be a description that explains all of that. But if you don't need Google or play store, etc it's a good tablet. Unfortunately it just won't work for me.",,,,
5,,Great while it worked! Two years nearly to the day it will not turn on! Loved this reader but a longer life span would be great. Little pricey for two years use.,,,
6,,,"Very disappointing – this tablet is not worth an update Once again, a tablet billed as “all-new” is anything but.  I suppose if you are buying an 8” tablet for the first time, the new Fire HD models may be worth considering (although there are better deals and features from other manufacturers – see below).  However, if you’re thinking of an upgrade over your current Fire 8”, you may want to wait, or look elsewhere.Yes, the new Fire HD 8 and 8 Plus are somewhat faster than previous models – but previous models work just fine for almost everything we do with a small tablet: email, video, and web browsing.  The screen on the new Fire 8 is the same resolution and size as on previous models, even though the body of the new Fire 8 is now wider (which means you’ll need a new case, too).So what do you get for $89 or (for the Plus) $109?  You get a USB-C connection, and a modest speed increase. That’s it.  There is nothing here that defines the new Fire 8 as “all new.”  This tablet is billed as “allowing you to enjoy your favorite apps,” but you could already do that with previous models.  And the heavily-touted battery life of 12 hours?  That’s the same claim Amazon made for the Fire 8 in 2018!A truly useful step would have been an upgraded screen, but we don’t get that feature on the Fire 8.If you are eager to get a new 8” tablet, you may want to consider other products.  For instance, the new Lenovo Smart Tab M8 costs $99, but for the extra $10 you get a tablet with the same size screen, RAM, and processor speed as the Fire 8, but the M8 is physically smaller, lighter, has a metal body (instead of plastic like the Fire), and ships with smart charging dock for no additional cost.Someday, Amazon will create a tablet that is indeed “all new.”  Today is not that day.",,
7,"Nice QOL changes, but not a huge upgrade from the 2018 model (Don't even both with the HD8 non-plus) [TL;Dr] IMO, the Amazon fire tablets are the ONLY <$100 tablets worth buying. If you Already have the last gen Fire HD 8,  this only offer a mild upgrade, maybe wait for a sale.But If you're looking for your first budget tablet, go ahead and grab this![Amazon annoyances]Amazon has pretty much been the king of budget tablets, sure there are some annoying things, like no Google Play Store, poor youtube support, annoying bloatware, etc. But ALL of these could be solved with a quick YouTube search ;-)[Should you buy this?]Unless you're looking to buy a higher end tablet used on eBay, I'd say go with this!And if you order an older used tablet online, sure you may get better specs, but it may be scratched, the battery may be starting to go bad, it may no longer be getting security updates, etc.This tablet's a little on the slow side, sure, but if you just want something for web browsing, email, social media, video, and some light gaming/retro emulation (nothing post N64/PS1)Then it will work great![2018 version vs 2020 version]I'd been using the older '8th gen' model Amazon fire hd 8, and this new 2020 model offers some nice improvements.A new Upgraded CPU (2.0ghz, up from 1.3ghz), new upgraded GPU, it now runs Fire OS7 (based on android 9. So it should be compatible with more apps than the previous model.The wifi/BT module has also been upgraded, it feels a bit more reliable, and it now supports the faster Wi-Fi 802.11-AC, and Bluetooth 5.0The usb connection has also been improved to USB-C, but don't get too excited, it's only running usb 2.0, so no HDMI out, and transfers would be slower than usb 3.0.Without any technical data/benchmarks/speed test, I'd say it feels marginally faster than the older model, maybe 20%-30% with my current work load.While the screen is the same size, they've adjusted the overall tablet shape a bit to make it shorter, with rounder edges.And the speakers are moved to the top now, so it should keep your sound from getting muffled when sitting the tablet on a table propped up by a case.[What's the same 2018 vs 2020]Same 8"" 16:10 at about 720p,The cameras are just as bad as always, but they're fine for video chat.Both feature a headphone jack, and microSD card slot,and both are advertised to offer a 12hr battery life.[2020 Fire HD fire 8 vs 2020 HD Fire 8 plus]There are really only two main advantages to the 'Plus' model,Wireless charging, and 50% extra ram.I'd say Don't even bother with the 'New 2020 HD fire 8 non-plus', sure you'd save a little money, but the 50% extra memory on this model would help a lot with some apps, and memory is not something you can upgrade down the line.The old 8th gen model only had 1.5gb or ram, so if you're upgrading that to the 2020-non-plus,then you're only getting about 33% more ram, where the Plus model DOUBLES the extra ram.In short if you're looking to install google play, the extra ram is a MUST! google services need the extra memory to work, and the less ram you have, the more they slow down the device.Additionally, if you like having multiple apps open at a time, the extra memory will allow you to keep more open in the background before their force closed.Wireless charging is nice too, but unless you're going with amazons special tablet stand, I'd say it's not a huge deal.",,,,
8,,"So much better than the previous generation I've had Fire tablets ever since the old 6"" model from 6 or 8 years ago. They're great as media consumption devices, so long as you understand what you're getting. They're not as responsive as Apple products, or as pretty, but you can also buy 8 of them for the price of one iPad Mini.That said, the performance gap has closed significantly with this new model. I buy a new one every other year give or take, and this one (2020 release) is so much more responsive than the 2018 model I had. The interface actually moves when you swipe, menus come up quickly, etc. It's still not a replacement for a ""real"" tablet, but it's far more pleasant to use.Media consumption continues to be the main/only use for it, and it excels at that. The screen is bright and colorful, the only issue with it being a pretty narrow field of view (it starts to dim pretty rapidly as you get past a couple degrees of viewing angle). Not too much of a problem since it's not really for sharing the screen, but I did notice some parallax while watching stuff in bed at night (where one eye would see it fine, and the screen was dimmer for the other eye). I have a Kindle Paperwhite for reading, and I don't think this screen would be great for ebook readers in comparison to a real e-paper reader.I don't think I've ever actually taken a picture with the built-in camera, so I couldn't tell you if it's any good. My guess is that regardless of what phone you have, it's probably better.Battery life has really improved in my experience. I don't have an hour estimate, but after watching a movie it's usually still at least at 80% or more.The browser is better than before, but still not great. Silk tries to cache pages to give the impression of speed, but it still feels slow, and pages still render weird a lot of the time. I don't use it for much unless I really need to look something up, even then I'll usually pull out my phone because it's more responsive.As far as apps are concerned, it's a mixed bag. It has most of the streaming services that are important to me: Disney+, HBO, MLB.tv, and (obviously) Prime Video. It also has apps for Netflix, Hulu, etc. I'm not sure about AppleTV+, but I don't actually know anyone that cares about that one anyway. As for other apps, they're there. That's about all I could really say. As I said, I use this pretty much exclusively as a media-consumption device, so I'm not downloading a ton of games or productivity apps.Overall I recommend this for a very narrow use case. If you want an iPad and think you can get away with spending a whole lot less by buying this, you're going to be disappointed. This is not that. That said, if all you want to be able to do is watch movies or TV shows in bed on a bigger screen than your phone, this does that job very well.",,,
9,,"Great I received the new Fire HD 8 Plus with dock for Christmas. Comparing it to my older Fire 8 (I think I got it in 2014 or a bit later, but I don't really remember), it has a brighter screen, an entirely different software package, and a usb c plug instead of micro usb (the biggest thing for me).My gift giver was generous enough to get me a version that wasn't ad supported, so to unlock the screen is similar to my phone. Hit the power button, swipe up, then enter your unlock code. I never had an unlock code on my previous kindle which was ad supported, so I'm not sure if it's something that comes with it not being ad supported or if it's just a new feature.After you unlock it, the kindle has a widget like thing for the most recently added stuff, be it apps, books, etc. Below that is a fairly standard grid of apps you have downloaded. Swiping to the right, you'll get the ""Library"" screen, which has section you can reorder dedicated to kindle, audible, amazon video, apps, and games. Each section when expanded shows the most recent, suggested, and some other categories depending on the type.I mostly use my Kindle Fire to read. My family sharing account has over 3000 kindle books available to me, so the organization of kindle books is of great importance to me, so I can actually find what I'm looking for. The software on this device does have the ""collection"" of books not in a collection, which I find very helpful. Other than that, the kindle software is mostly the same.I downloaded some stuff from audible and amazon video, but haven't used those apps enough to detail any new features. I haven't used the app store/games at all.If you swipe left from the home screen, you get the ""For You"" page. This is a combination of things you've used most recently and suggestions from Amazon of things you might want, including news stories, apps, books, things free with Prime, etc. It seems mostly like they wanted to create something enticing for people to spend time on, but also try to drag you deeper into the Amazon ecosystem at the same time.As for the hardware, the screen seems good, I got a slightly matte screen protector for it, and that seemed to help with some of the eye strain from staring at a screen for a long period of time. I haven't tried the speakers, and typically when I would use the audio, I'd be using headphones, so I can't really speak to that. The power and volume buttons are on the top instead of the side. There are 2 cameras, one on the top back corner, one in the middle of a long side on front. They work as expected.I like the dock. There are certainly a lot of improvements to it that I can see (using the usb-C cable to plug in the dock, having the dock be foldable for travel, etc) but I don't see anything else out there in a brief search that has those features, so I'll stick with what I've got. It can charge my phone, but only if I take my phone out of it's case. It can charge the fire HD 8 Plus, even in the case (I got this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B088RHLZFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).Overall, I'm happy with the product, though I wish Amazon would improve the organization available to kindle books. Audible now will organize by Genre, at least on the phone, and Google books will organize by series (I REALLY want Amazon to implement this). Oh well, one can always hope for next time.",,,
0,,Easy gift Bought as a gift for a child so that they can have the same screen device for a couple years. The tablet is very easy to set up and use.,,,
1,"How could anyone not have taken advantage of this FIRE tablet and pricing? EDIT: I have now had this Kindle Fire Tablet for a few weeks, and I will throughly review this purchase to my fullest and honest opinion.The latest 2020 Kindle Fire 8 HD model at its pricing is well worth the purchase for an entry leveled tablet user that can't afford the more higher brand models. This model version can easily compete with those higher priced brands.PROS:PRICE: Even without the holiday special pricing, purchasing either the 32GB or 64GB internal storage devices are a steal as they both can be purchased for less than 200 dollars even with the advertisement removal.The 2020 HD version features a faster processor of 3 GB RAM and a quad core processor which makes the overall process of using the Fire tablet (for streaming movies, playing games and browsing the internet much faster.Like all of the tablets being produced nowadays (regardless of brand) the internet browsers are stressing the usage of the child safety features which will make for internet browsing a more safer and worry free place for children to navigate.SIZE: The size of the tablet is perfect for both adults and children for everyday usage and not heavy like other models.BATTERY LIFE: Superb and as advertised, works very well and lasts a long time. It recharges rather quickly as well.CONS:The ADS waiver pay to have remove is an absolute annoyance, I'd personally pay full price to have it removed permanently.AMAZON BASED BLOATWARE: I understand the financial need to recoup financial losses for having an tablet this cost effective, yet certain third party and Amazon based apps, that clutter up the screen interface would be better served being relageted to the AMAZON store.The buttons (Volume, OFF/ON) are in a strange place when not using in landscape mode.The FIRE OS for one operating off of the ANDROID system is rather limited and having to do a soft jailbreak shouldn't need be, for a system and tablet that would be wonderful to use.BLUE MODE. While I have an awesome Paperwhite for reading, when using this Fire Tablet for its Kindle feature, it's still too bright despite lowering the brightness levels both on the Kindle app and Fire system.AMBIVILENCE:USER FREINDLINESS: Upon its initial usage, Kindle makes it a point to teach Kindle neophytes how to use their Kindle Fire, yet I initially purchased a lesser versioned Fire Tablet to test out how user friendly this tablet would be for my mother-in-law for everyday game playing. I myself am rather electronically savvy and upon her initial entry into the FIRE/ANDROID OS she might need my help installing apps, yet I see this as a device she should have no issues adjusting to from her iOS device, which is no longer software upgradable.CONCLUSION: While the lists of CONS are what many here have mentioned my be a detraction or maybe even a hindrance to potential buyers, at this price and Amazon's ever growing and beautiful ecosystem, many including myself that have purchased more expensive tablets from other companies yet find my second ( I did purchase a wonderful FIRE 7 which I traded in soon there after for the 8HD Plus)  a wonderful foray in AMAZON's wonderful ecosystem with much more purchases to come for other family members.Thank you AMAZON as I will revisit this review one year from now.",,,,
2,Its nice but.... Why are ads manditory on the lock screen?I should be able to shut the ads off.,,,,
3,,"Tablet and wireless charger are great...Avoid the trade in program This new Fire 8 HD Plus is a leap above the 8th gen Fire 8 HD.  Speed and battery are great.  The QI wireless charging works like a charm.  The 3gb of RAM definitely shows in the use of the tablet.Here is my beef.  The trade in program is a joke.  They quote you $10 for the 8th Gen and when you mail it in they say that it didn't meet standards and reduce the amount to $5 and charge you the extra $5.  I don't know how mine didn't meet the standards.  It had a screen protector since day 1 and a case.  No scratches, not blemishes, full charge, wiped as ordered.  This seems to not meet their standards.  I have been hosed on their trade in program before trading in a Echo 1st Gen so you would think I would have learned my lesson.  Amazon gives you a joke of a trade in and then they cut that joke in half or all together and expect you to just grin and bare it.BE WARNED, DO NOT USE THE TRADE IN PROGRAM.  While I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon I will never promote their trade in program and I will voice my opinion anytime someone is thinking of using it.  Shame on you Amazon.",,,

9,,,"Fire 8plus tablet not worth the hype I’ve had several Kindles then Kindle Fires as I am a big reader. I was excited about when the Kindle Fire came out & loved the 1st couple. Then it’s as if they forgot the whole reason Kindle was invented and Amazon tried to make it their version of an iPad. Even so, it was easy to use and great if you needed it for smaller things an this tablet could do. Then they got worse like Apple. This Fire plus I got may have a few good features but they basically creates this so you would be forced to buy new chargers, new covers, everything. Just like Apple did. All to make a buck. It backfired on Apple with people being furious they have to buy “extras”and I’ve no doubt people feel the same regarding this plot they conveniently left off in their descriptions. I know I am! Between adding apps I don’t want/need (that take up unnecessary storage), you can’t have access to many apps you might want as Apple wants all the benefits and control. Amazon got so caught up in making a competitive tablet, they lost sight of what made people want Kindle-an ereader that is the best. But it’s so cluttered that when you are able to look through the Kindle for books, they don’t help you find the bestselling books or even provide lists like The New Your Times Bestsellers and such which makes it difficult to find popular, varied or new options. One of the things they changed from the original Fire 8 was that the power button was on the top right side (looking at it) so it was perfect for right handed people to easily shut on and off. Now it’s not only on the left hand side but it has the volume buttons first on that corner, then the power button which has to be on of the most annoying and inconvenient places, regardless of what hand you use, to get to the powers button. It came originally in the format I preferred when turned on and updated without my permission and I’m back to pages where they only show one line of current books, then a line of apps, then video and so on. One page should easily be dedicated to books if only to remember and focus that IT IS AN E READER FIRST for the bulk of the people who buy it. Not for iTunes (which you can’t get) and such.I get adapting and adding but make your own tablet and go back to what made Kindle Fire so popular in the 1st place! Help owners find/discover new and/or popular books instead of whatever Kindle now churns out as badly edited, badly written books, esp if you buy or sample books and then they only show you others similar and that may not be what you’re (only) looking for. I’m sorely disappointed Amazon follows Apple in this. I thought they were better than that. Also be warned that if you don’t carefully comb through the settings, certain ones can be let as it and you’re being charged for something you’re not using and may not know about! I even miss when they had a large variety of setting your layout (fonts, size, etc.) bc now that’s limited even down to slowly increasing the size of the words to what’s perfect for you. Now, it’s go from dot to dot and each one is a huge difference- such as smaller then the next option is TOO LARGE and there’s no in between. I also remember those little things were why people started buy Kindles-for those with visual issues. And be careful as the last 3 Kindles I bought basically broke mainly via the charging area so there’s no “reusing them” as one can’t even charge it! (And don’t get me started on the crappy chargers I bought through Amazon  for the Kindle where every single one broke but ones found in stores or gas stations never broke!) if they don’t go back to their original way-a quality e reader, that lasted, they’re going to lose their monopoly because people won’t put up with it. The libraries are always free and you can go to a bookstore to look for books you want and then go to the library among many other options. Nickel & diming every little thing will lose you business every time! Be better Amazon-you once were.",,

1,Fire HD 8 is bigger and lighter than my old Kindle I like that it is bigger and lighter which makes it easier to read digital books. The only drawback is that you can't use some of the apps that you can use on your phone.,,,,
2,"Definitely a step up. But...... This is my third Kindle Fire. I still have my other 2, a 6"" one about 6 years old and a 7"" one 4 years old, plus a Kindle e-reader that's at least 7 years old. All still work perfectly, so overall I have nothing bad to say about them. I loved the 6 "" one, but upgraded to the next one because it didn't have expandable storage and it was close to the size of my phone.  While I loved the 7"" for the orange color and expandable storage, and have used it for years, I felt the shape was a bit awkward and it was always a bit laggy when accessing my offline prime music or book library. But as a traveling companion, (who wants to bring their $$ iPad to work and leave in their desk?), it was overall pretty good. Like some people who complain that it's ""not an iPad"", or "" it can't get things from Google play"", I never thought, worried, or expected any of these things. If those people had read the specs they would not have been surprised about the product they purchased. When I saw this newest Fire, the first thing that caught my eye other than the increased ram was the size. It is the same size as my beloved iPad mini! The battery life is outstanding, and the screen is very crisp while watching movies, and it's definitely quicker.....EXCEPT when accessing my offline prime music and book collections!  When I went to set it up it asked my if I wanted to restore it from my older kindle backup, I was so happy that all my all my stuff would easily transfer... But no. I installed an SD card first thing, and formatted it, as I needed the available space for the transfer. Then, when I tried to restore it, it said the ""network was busy"", then it asked me to format the card again, then I reset and tried to restore again, and the ""network was busy"", repeat....repeat...repeat.....Finally I just had to manually redownload all my offline prime music and all my books, which took over a week and made both the music and reading apps unusable while it occurred. And then, even though I tried to sync my system, all of my games are back to the beginning. None of my progress was transferred! And this may be more of an kindle reading app problem, not a system one, but why do the books only show up as read on the device you read them on? Books I have already read on my old Fire now show up as unread on my new Fire! And it shows what books you own and which are downloaded, but it should show which are NOT downloaded so you can easily figure out which ones you still need to download. All that being said, that was a very annoying issue on my older Fire as well. Both the kindle and music apps on the new Fire seem to have different features than the standalone apps on iPad or Android devices, which is puzzling. I would think that Amazon would make these apps work seamlessly across all devices. I was excited about the trade in program, but I didn't use it because I felt the values were a little low, so I kept my old ones. Overall, this Kindle Fire is a step up from the previous ones and I feel it's worth the money and would recommend it to anyone. If this is your first Fire, setup will be a breeze and you'll love it for the device it is. If you are upgrading? Well Amazon, you need to make that progress a whole lot simpler.",,,,

4,,,"If you like being OWNED by Amazon's Ad department... Bought a new Fire 8 WITHOUT ads, using it mainly for Amazon Prime shopping and for portable media - kindle, video, audio (with good earphones). Giving it a 3 star review because Amazon has gone over the top on intrusive violations of my privacy as their default settings.Note, I paid extra because I don't like advertising. Turns out that paying extra doesn't exempt you from Amazon's own, increasingly invasive attempts to get you to consume their stuff.I  hope the following little rant helps others turn off the Amazon multilayered Adscape quickly and easily.First, and least offensive: on the startup screen I kept getting ""notifications"" which were ads for kindle content. When I consistently swiped left on them I got a message asking if I wished to continue to see them. When I selected 'no' they stopped.Second, on the Home screen, in the New section, Amazon puts  an ad for their content. Delete it and there is a new one the next time you turn it on. No offer to stop displaying these if you keep deleting them, but It turns out that if you go to Settings and search New you can *eventually* get to a screen that lets you turn them off. That took me half an hour to find, and leaves me pissed off.Third, and in my opinion worst (at least so far, I've only had it a week and it keeps pulling new shenanigans) was that it up and downloaded an entire episode of a show I actively DO NOT EVER want to see, without any advance notification, much less any request for permission to do so.  I promptly deleted the video file and, after some searching, discovered the place where I could turn off their ability to, spontaneously and with no warning, download whatever content they thought I might like whenever they chose to do so.At this point, I subliminally cuss whenever I pick the thing up.  One more of these unpleasantly intrusive little surprises and I will give up the Fire tablet for good.  I can use the kindle app on my iPad.If Amazon is going to include a bunch of unasked for advertising and media downloads then the LEAST they can do is gather all of those settings in one place in the Settings menu so that I don't have to spend half an hour EACH to find the way to turn them off.While I'm listing the things I don't like about the Fire tablet, I used to use it for shopping via the included Amazon Prime app.  I have two complaints, one is that if I use that app I cannot set it to credit my Amazon Smile charity choice; I have to go to Amazon Smile via the web browser to make my purchase, and sometimes I forget.  It seems to me that if they can track my consumption habits then they could also link my charity preference to my Prime account.My bigger complaint is that they have apparently redone the shopping interface for the tablet; I used to get the same search results, layout, product information and choices on the tablet as I did via the web interface. Not anymore. As I strongly prefer the web interface, I'm back to shopping on my iPad's browser, on Amazon Smile.The Kindle Fire just got a LOT less useful to me.  If there are no more unpleasant surprises regarding unwanted content and pushy advertising then I will probably keep it, but I see no reason to ever buy another. I'm not going through this again.*******Update, the next day:😠 This morning there was a new ad in the NEW section on my Home page.  I thought I got rid of those yesterday, but apparently not. This time I didn't select delete, I opened it. I found myself in a program called Amazon Insider, and from within it I was able to go to its Settings menu and - over its protests - turn off all further ""insider updates"".  Amazon Insider is software which comes preloaded and which is NOT listed as an app or accessible from within the Settings menu, so there is no way to turn it off without going into it once via an ad.The Fire is NOT a device designed to let you easily access your Prime account and do a good job of playing media; it is advertised that way, but it comes with multiple honey traps to maneuver you into consuming what Amazon wants you to consume, and I have found it time-consuming and frustrating to turn off all those traps, after having paid extra to have it ""ad free"".😠",,
5,Good for the price This item isn't for me. Won't know until Christmas,,,,
6,,great buy! Bought for 2 grand kids!  They don't want to put them down!,,,
7,,"The HD8 Plus and the Wireless Charging Dock are Aces thus far! I sure like the wireless charging and not having to fool around with the charging cable anymore!  The additional gig and a half of RAM over the old HD8 models that only had a gig and a half to begin with, and/or a gig more than the new two gig regular HD8 and HD10 models, is quite an advance too since, as far as I'm concerned, all tablets and phones should have a minimum of two gigs; thus, so far, this Plus tablet zings!  I think the wireless charging dock should be smaller, that is narrower, than it is though.  It takes up too much space in a limited space environment like I have.  I think it should only be as wide as the HD8 tablet in portrait (vertical) mode.  When you're charging the tablet in landscape (horizontal) mode, the dock doesn't need to be as wide as the tablet, and the ends of the tablet could ""hang"" over the left and rights edges of the dock.  And, because I don't use the Show Mode at all, and keep the tablet in vertical (portrait) mode, it sure would be nice to have the charging dock only as wide as the tablet in that mode.So, I recommend to Amazon and/or the manufacturers of the dock that they make it narrow(er) and only as wide as the HD8 Plus tablet [the wireless charging ONLY works with that model tablet, NOT the regular HD8 tablets---or the HD10 (although it should, and hopefully will with the next incarnation{s} of the HD10 next year?)] in portrait (vertical) mode; since, even in that configuration, the tablet laying in it in horizontal (landscape) mode would work just fine with a narrower dock [though the charging dock for the HD10 would have to be of different design for wireless charging of course, but that charger could be narrower than the HD10 in landscape (horizontal) mode, too].Additional pros are the increase in storage space of course (I should have bought the 2018 HD8 with 32 gigs of storage instead of only 16 gigs), and the faster quad-core CPU (processor) [I sure wish they'd put the octa-core processor in the HD8 tablets that the HD10 tablet has though (but it doesn't make sense that those tablets with an octa-core CPU only have two gigs of RAM memory, when they should have at least three gigs too)].  Thus, that's the pros and some recommendations (in addition to some other thoughts), and now to....The cons are what I touched on above, as well as the lousy speakers (although the sound can be boosted with apps that are available), and Amazon's continued bucking of the Google Play Store for their own far-inferior Appstore [for the latter I recommend the Windows program, ""Amazon Fire Toolbox"" ( just Google it---there's that Google again!  :op ) to install Google Play's four files onto Amazon tablets automatically, which is quite convenient; and it also has some other nice conveniences that I won't go into here (which I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with!)].  I can't recall any other cons right now, or I haven't noticed any yet; therefore, I will update with further pros and cons if I come across and/or am reminded of any.Overall, I recommend this tablet, and the wireless charging dock if you opted for it as well, and I believe you will be happy with its and/or their functionality and convenience.",,,
8,Works well for what it is. I gave this four stars instead of five. I've been begging Amazon to come out with a new HDX 8.9. This is what I had to get as an alternative. I like to take mine when I travel. The screen is smaller on this one and it weighs much more than the HDX 8.9. Don't know why they didn't stick with a good thing. The bigger screened one (the 10 in. one) is REALLY heavy....does have a good screen size. Works for home use. This one would have been perfect if it weighed less and the screen was bigger.,,,,

8,"Some great fetures, some annoying glitches After about 4 months I have mixed feelings about my Fire HD 8 Plus device.Because of the core reading functionality I give it 4 stars, because what I care most about using the device for is reading, with some occasional listening and watching.  As a general purpose tablet I would give it 2 stars, and for certain general aspects of the functionality I'd give it 1 or 2 stars.Good: The screen is good.  The wireless charging is good.  The core reading, listening, and watching functionality is good.Annoying: Some general tablet functionality stuff and some of the app features just don't work right.* The maps app is kind of lame* The tablet's sensing of compass direction is awful* The detection of location is glitchy.  A month after buying the device I moved to a different town in a different state but for things like telling me the local weather it keeps thinking I am in my previous home, which is almost 700 miles away.  Sometimes, but not always.  It's weird and unpredictable and it makes no sense.* The Audible app has some ""Stats & Badges"" to track your listening history, but after listening for a few months the history is pretty messed up.  It seems to not track how much I've listened over the past several days.  When presenting the cumulative listening time as a ""listening level"", about a week ago it just stopped accumulating listening time.* The wireless audio feature sounds good but has a lot of the problems I have with all bluetooth devices in general, and I don't know which end the problem is on (or if it's just inherent in the Bluetooth technology.  I have a bunch of Bluetooth devices in my home, and getting the right things paired with each other and staying that way is kind of a pain, and sometimes it's hard to tell what you're paired with.  Having some long numerical protocol address or device ID number is not particularly useful.Some things just bug me about the way a lot of things work, and there doesn't seem to be any place to complain about those things; particularly the cloud based services.* When I'm listening to music, I really don't want every couple of minutes to be interrupted by a reduction in audio volume while I get a little notification sound that some more e-mail has arrived.* The music streaming service is kind of frustrating, though I have that problem with all of the music streaming services.  It seems to insist on presenting music to me in a way that is not how I listen to music.* The recommender systems for books, music, and video are all sort of useless.  They seem more interested in pushing me into some predetermined bucket of ""people who read/watch/listen to X also read/watch/listen to Y"" than actually suggesting things I'm interested in.  For example if I read/watch/listen to a single very popular item just to find out what the fuss is about, but then am not really interested, it decides because I read/watched/listened to that one thing I must love all the similar most popular items, which I usually don't.",,,,

0,,"Great tablet...if you expect to get what you pay for. So I've had my Fire HD 8 Plus for a few days now and thought I'd share my impressions.Let me say that so far, I'm really enjoying this little tablet. I went into this expecting a device that would stream content - not much more than that - and to date, I'm very pleased. Netflix, Amazon Prime (and a few channels I subscribe to), Plex, Disney+, and others work just fine, and the quality is fantastic for an 8"" screen. I haven't run into any problems so far. I was a subscriber to HBO and Shudder, but I simply canceled those memberships and joined again through Amazon Prime Video channels. The pricing is exactly the same, so why not, and they work flawlessly.Yes, there are ads that display on the lock screen, but that doesn't bother me at all. In fact, sometimes I find the suggestions useful.I've installed a few social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), and again, no problems there. I had to get used to the interface as it differs from my iOS devices, but on the whole, it was painless.The Kindle app is very important to me (I own an Amazon Oasis) and for viewing content that is graphically heavy, it's great. It's also very cool that I can order Kindle content, and have it sent to my Oasis, AND my Fire HD 8.WiFi is speedy and by taking advantage of Amazon's pre-configuration, it was the very definition of simple to connect to my router.Battery life can be an issue for some, but I am VERY happy with how the HD 8 performs. It actually beats the battery life of my Oasis, which I find surprising.The one thing that I would point out as a *slight* negative: the screen attracts fingerprints like crazy. I find myself continually cleaning my screen ('cause that's how I roll). It would be awesome if Amazon would offer a screen protector, but on searching for one, I came up empty.I ordered the HD 8 Plus (10th Generation, watch for that) case, and it fits like a glove. Some have written reviews to the effect that the case feels ""cardboardy"" - for want of a better term - but for me, it provides a nice level of comfort that my device is protected.So those are my first impressions. If you're looking for an iPad replacement, look elsewhere, or bite the bullet and order an iPad. For what I want, the HD 8 Plus performs.ADDENDUM: 8.14.2020Wireless charging is a big plus and works with any of the 3 wireless chargers I have. It even charges in the case, which surprised me; my iPhone has to be removed from the case to charge wirelessly. Very cool!ADDENDUM: 11.18.2020Still no major complaints. Sometimes the Wi-fi seems a bit sluggish (I have at least 300mbps through wifi) but nothing that is too annoying. Time to time streaming video apps have to buffer, but it's not awful. But having said that, the utilities offered for the Fire HD 8 are really POOR. I have tried several optimizations, and general-purpose utility apps and they are mostly useless. I confess it would be nice if the FireOs would open the Google Play Store.",,,

3,,,"Returned. Waiting Until They Work Some Bad Bugs Out When someone who already had a Kindle Fire for 2.5 years buys another Fire, and returns it, you know something is wrong.You know it is not because they don't like Fire tablets, because they bought a second one.You really know it is not because they don't know how to use a Fire tablet.(Well, something else is wrong too: the first Fire should have lasted AT LEAST three years. But no, the 10"" tablet USB micro B connector went really bad long before it should have. So I bought another one! Even though we all know planned obsolescence is a poor reason to buy anything.)I got extremely rare good luck: I got an intelligent technician who witnessed by screen-sharing how both tablets worked.(Most of the time you will get someone to whom you describe the settings you changed and how they performed, who says, ""Now go up to the top right corner where it says ""Sign In"".)(1)a) I like to use landscape mode. On my old tablet, when an app works only in portrait mode opened, as soon as I closed that app, my entire tablet went back to landscape mode, just the way I had set it.b) On my new tablet, when I opened an app that used only portrait mode, when I closed it, my entire tablet's settings were hijacked and set into portrait mode.I had to set it, cycling through, to ""auto-rotate"", then to ""landscape"". . . Every. Single. Time.If you have my usual luck, you will reach a technician who just thinks you aren't bright enough to set your own settings. I got lucky and the good tech witnessed the hijacking of my settings. And saw that the old tablet did not do that!(2)a) I used my old tablet for 2.5 years (should have lasted for 3 years) to order more stuff from amz than I can remember. Of *course* I was able to choose which address, which payment method, which delivery window I wanted each time.b) The new tablet app wouldn't let me choose payment method or delivery speed. You could poke holes in the screen jabbing at it, to no avail.(3) For an 8"" Plus, with 3Gb memory instead of my old 2 Gb, it was awfully slow. I have never watched a tablet wake up and show only the titles of all the icons on the home page, and mosey around taking its good old time waking up before the icons themselves showed up. It was slow in other ways too.(4) I had a micro SD card in my old Fire the whole time. I didn't save all those files just to have them locked away from me forever. I put the card in my new 8 Plus, and that thing wanted to format it! No freaking way!Now if an Apple or maybe a Windows machine, or maybe my Linux laptop, couldn't read it, I would think, okay, different operating systems. But another Kindle Fire?? Really???I appreciate the really excellent service the technician gave me. Really, it is the first time I have had assistance that good. Yeah, we know how to go to the upper right and sign in on the yellow button. Sheeesh. And I also know how good it is to find someone who doesn’t assume that you don't know how to use your own settings.But after they got back to me (I told you it was good service) and said that ""Software engineering is working on it"", hoo boy. I knew it wasn't going to be another few days, and someone would just flip an account setting switch and voila! all better now.I knew I was in it for the long haul.At that point, it was ""I'm returning this, and I'll come back when the New And Improved Kindle Fire doesn't work far worse than my old Kindle Fire.""It's supposed to be, you know, better.But this could take a while. Some serious bugs.And now I am without a tablet. I don't like it, but having the second one was even more painful. I felt like an involuntary beta tester.Now, we wait.",,
4,,"NICE READING DEVICE I like my Kindle Fire for reading. This is my fourth Kindle but my first Fire. As other reviews have stated, this is NOT an iPad. It was not intended for that. It is a nice little inexpensive entry level device. I have an iPad and iPhone, so I purchased this device to carry my books with me wherever and whenever I want. Because I am an artist, teacher, and avid reader, I wanted a color device to be able to view art books and graphic novels. The regular Kindles are black & white, which is a serious handicap for viewing visual media. I further did not want to load up my iPad with dozens of books. This little device allows me to browse the web, shop the Amazon site, view media on Amazon Prime or other streaming services, and of course, to read books - both text and color photographs. Now the Cons… my biggest complaint is that it is awkward to navigate and move books around when organizing them into collections. I have also had trouble with downloading books to the Kindle from my Amazon Content and Devices website storage area. I was able to work through this problem but it took about 30 minutes to troubleshoot. As long as Kindle has been around, Amazon should have worked these programming issues out with an update. Since I found other owners having similar problems, I know it was not an issue unique to me. Overall, as a reading device, I highly recommend. As an eTablet, you would be better off with a low end iPad. NOTE: If you want to store your library on your device, get the most memory you can afford. Kindles do not hold nearly as many books as they advertise and when you start to fill up the memory, they can act a little quirky.",,,
5,,"Kindle Fire HD+ 8"" Tablet I'm writing this review after more than a year.I bought the very first Kindle Fire tablet for my wife, and she loved it, but it ended up with a severely swollen battery which turned me off of the Kindle Fire line altogether, and so for the past 11 years I have only used the Kindle apps, and the e-ink Kindles, which work great, but have a few serious drawbacks.First, some Kindle purchases won't work on the e-ink Kindles, but will on the Kindle app.  Granted, Amazon does say which ones will, and which ones don't, but after 11 years of purchases... it can render the e-ink devices less than useful.  Second, the e-ink devices are slow, and when you get used to using the app on a decent tablet, it can make them a little frustrating.That said, there are times where you don't want to hold up a large tablet in order to read the Kindle books that won't work on the e-ink Kindles, and so I figured the Fire line must have improved since that original Kindle Fire I purchased in 2012, and decided to purchase the HD+ 8... hoping the '+' would bring enough 'under the hood' to make it useful, and the 8 inch design of course because I wanted something smaller and more portable.I have not been disappointed!After more than a year it is still going strong.  The battery still holds more than 95% of it's original charge, and I find I often grab this over my larger tablet.  The size and weight really are perfect for a Kindle as well as a grab and go tablet.  USB-C means pretty much every charger I have works with it, and the expandable storage means there's always more room.  While quad-core, the architecture is still 32bit ARM, but you wouldn't know it with the Cortex A53s it is equipped with, so there really aren't any issues streaming content, or slowness of any kind.Amazon has done a great job with this Kindle Fire, and I absolutely recommend it, not only as a compact portable tablet, but as a Kindle as well!",,,

1,,"A great entertainment device for the money. What can I add to the thousands of mostly positive reviews here? Let me try to just add a different perspective without all of the tech talking points that seem to be well covered here. Our last Fire was the HDX model a few years back. We still have it and it is working fine. My son uses it. The hard drive is too small so we are always running out of space. I have owned various tablets from Apple and Samsung as well. I just wanted a device I could watch some shows on, read a little (I have a Kindle Oasis that I keep on my night stand) when I am out of the house, listen to occasional music, and can surf the web in lieu of my phone. The Fire 8 Plus checks those boxes. Frankly, as a long time Prime member, it is actually ideal. This device is highly integrated into the Amazon ecosystem. I read so many reviews that made this out to be a bad thing. I get that on some level but thats kind of missing the point to me. Thats actually exactly what I want. I still have access to my Netflix and Spotify accounts but I can also just hit the Video menu button and immediately be placed into my Prime video menu. Its really great. Another common complaint is the lack of the Google Android Play Store. It is a valid complaint. I have never really understood this decision by Amazon. It seems like a lot of work for no reason on Amazon's part but it does keep you in Amazon's playground. Regardless, for me its fine. The app store offers all the big name apps I want or need. This just isn't a negative for me and what I want out of the device. The screen is good. I could nitpick it for sure. Its a bit dull and really not bright enough if you are under bright lights. Outdoor viewing would be nearly impossible in the sun. Its not the fastest tablet either. You will notice it if your phone is a relatively current flagship model but it works fine.For what its worth, I am pretty picky about my tech. This newest Kindle just gets it done. It has a solid battery life, good screen, its well made, and its built to do exactly what I needed it to do. If you spend a lot of time in the Amazon ecosystem, at approximately $120, this borders on being a must buy. Just know what you want. If you are looking for a fast vivid tablet that is diverse, this probably isn't it. If you need something that is productive as a work tool, this definitely isn't it. If you want an inexpensive little entertainment machine though, I don't think you will find a better addition to your arsenal of tech at a better price than this.",,,

6,"It's great if you back it Out of the box it's a three-star device. If you are intending to use it for serious stuff there's several things I advise. The first thing is get 32 gig  model. Then go online and get the workaround that will give you the Google Play store. After that the first thing you should do is put in the Google keyboard. It's called Gboard. I found the native keyboard to be really stubbornly difficult. Particularly with The swipe style of typing. Make sure you get the model that has wireless charging. These devices have a weak spot if you plug it in and out a lot, which I do. You avoid that with the wireless charging. It works with recent models of wireless charges, not necessarily from Amazon. To be safe get the Amazon wireless charger and pay the premium.  I strongly advise waiting for the mega sales like Black Friday stuff. They give serious discounts on the Amazon tablets. Very serious.",,,,

8,,"A week later Out of the box I wasn't sure the Fire 8 was going to meet my needs.  I was lookng from something similar to my old Samsung Tab A and had hoped this would be a seamless transition.  The Fire 8 is really set up as an Amazon product that would, of course, expose you to more Amazon products that you can purchase.  Books, games, access to the Amazon web page are front & center.  If you are enmeshed in that echo system then this might be the product for you, I wasn't.  I was looking for a more traditional  android  experience.  After my initial dismay I decided to see if I could whip ithe Fire into shape and make it work for me.  With a little research I was able to figure out how to install the Google play store on the Fire 8.  That worked & I was able to download the apps that I wanted & needed. The next challenge was to figure out how to reduce the ads that Amazon kept displaying on the home screen under the headings of ""For You"" and ""Library"" as well as those as part of Amazon in the ""Home"" screen.  They were there in the form of recommendations and they took up a significant portion of the home screen.  Ads for Children's games & books to purchase were overwhelming!  With some perseverance & searching through system settings I was able to reduce it significantly.  For me its  now a perfectly acceptable lower cost tablet.  But it didn't come without  work on my part.  I do recommend this tablet; it has some nice features including a good display, reasonably fast processor, and a comfortable non-slippery case.  The size was just right for my needs.",,,

I also own the 2021 Fire Tablet 10 with the keyboard case accessory. That's a great unit as well, but I digress. The Fire 8 Plus brings that same processing power, memory, and battery life into a smaller package along with wireless charging capability. It's really a great unit and is currently my every day carry. I know I could do some turns and tricks to get the G--gle Play Store on the device, but I've been happy with just using the Amazon App store for the device, realizing that there is a lot I can do in the Silk Browser that continues to make this a very functional device. One of my favorite features about the Operating System is the allowance of formatting your MicroSD Card as Internal or Portable Storage.

1,"Good Kitchen or Bedside Tablet But Poor Selection of Apps I was trying to decide between the Fire HD 10 tablet and Amazon's Fire HD 8 Plus and ended up going for the 8 plus because of the higher 3 GB of RAM. It's a great kitchen tablet to read the paper in the morning (it comes with a six-month trial of paid Washington Post), to have on your bedside as a Kindle reader, or as a smart clock with Alexa in the show mode that gives it Echo functionality. Fire OS is unfortunately limited so plan to only use this tablet to consume Amazon content (Netflix and Hulu can also be downloaded).Pros● Comes with more RAM than the Fire HD 8 and the Fire HD 10—giving it a smooth experience in game mode and while having several apps open.● Screen feels like the ""right size""—not too small like the Fire HD 7 and not too large for Kindle reading like the Fire HD 10 (which would probably easily fall on my face when trying to read).● Compatible with wireless charging stand (sold separately).● Decent battery life good for long trips (2021 where are you?).● Has Echo functionality in show mode. As mentioned above, this makes it a good stationary device to use as a kitchen, living room, or bedside tablet.● It includes a blue-light filter for nighttime reading.Cons● Fire OS (based on the older Android 9) is outdated and limiting. While I know that this tablet is mainly designed to consume Amazon content and not for productivity (e.g, shopping, music, prime video, and Kindle-reading—which it does well), it's disappointing that even many major social media apps like Youtube and Reddit aren't available in its app store. There's only a browser-based knock-off Youtube app. You can side-load the Google Play store, but I rather not mess with adding or having to keep track of any third-party settings. Aside from the polished Amazon apps, many of the other apps in the app store feel very cheap and low quality.● A lot of upselling. It feels like every other app is trying to sell you an Amazon service—even if you're already a Prime member. Some longer free trials are worth it, like the 6-month Washington Post one. I get that this is how they keep the tablets so cheap, but sometimes it feels like more of an Amazon portal than my own device (marketing psychology says...yes).● Camera. Not really worth listing since most people don't use tablet cameras seriously, but it would have been a more worthwhile investment for them to integrate a good front video-conferencing camera rather than have two mediocre front and rear 2 MP cameras.Overall, as a casual consumer, it's worth it for the price and when I don't want to lug a laptop onto a cramped Amtrak or commuter rail for entertainment.",,,,
2,,"Works great most of the time but…. This is my third fire tablet eight. I decided to get the newest version with the extra memory and the wireless charging. I don’t use wireless charging often because I find plugging it in to be more efficient and faster. Most apps run pretty well. But I do notice that there seems to be all a lot of lagging between screens. Sometimes opening more then one program, it takes time for the fire to open an application. I suspect it’s because I placed an antivirus program on the tablet that is active full-time. I’m going to keep testing with the antivirus off and all to see what happens. When the programs are running there seems to be no lag whatsoever only between shifting from one application to another. This is a great little tablet for travel for me because I use it for lite games and movies. I do recommend the tablet for anybody who’s looking for something inexpensive and for some light web browsing and movie watching. Although personally I think you can simply get away with the regular 2 MB RAM version instead of the 3 MB version.",,,

9,,"I like this tablet Wow - nice update. I've owned a number of the older 7"" Fire tablets (and a couple of the 10"" Fire HDs) and never consider getting one of these 8"" tablets. Buying this one was sort of a spur of the moment purchase when I saw them on sale about a week ago. Like I said - I have two of the older model 7"" tablets, but neither one of those had the option of adding extra storage space and to be honest they seemed to be a bit slow in their operation. The two 10"" tablets are still great - but a bit too large to carry around with me during the day. So this 8"" one seemed to be a viable solution.One of the reasons I never really consider getting one of the 8"" Fire tablets is I sort of figured why bother 8"" isn't that much bigger than 7"" - I was wrong. The bigger screen size makes reading books with lot of images and text easier. I have a bunch of technical books in my Kindle collection, as well as books like the Bloom County comic strip books and the Calvin and Hobbes books. On the 7"" screen those are barely readable (one of the big reasons I bought the first 10"" Fire tablet). What's surprised me - is that while the screen is bigger, the case of the 8"" tablet is nearly the same size as the 7"" tablets. I can even use the same sleeve case that I have been using.This new tablet is fast (course, all new tablets seem fast - till something faster comes along). I really like the new operating system and the way the menus and control screens work. Vast improvement over the older models. The one and only comment (complaint?) I have is about the screen itself. All of the previous Amazon tablets I've bought the screens have been glass - slick glass. This new tablet's screen feels a little different - it has a bit of friction to it where my finger tip doesn't slide across it like the previous tablets. Almost like there is a screen protector on it - but it doesn't appear to be. I'm sure I'll get use to it eventually - but for now it is a bit annoying.I added a 128GB memory card to the tablet (Samsung EVO select), and the tablet had to format it before it could be used. Formatting took a few minutes.  The tablet comes with a power charger and a charging cable.All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase and think this is the best tablet yet.",,,
0,"A Good Value Tablet For it's price this model year of kindle I honestly find to be worth it. The screen is mostly as good as advertised with occasional glare and is occasional prone to be a bit of fingerprint magnet. The battery is significantly improved in comparison to some older models and I find it to last days with moderate use. Honestly the main drawback would be it's lack of connectivity with Google apps (YouTube, Chrome,etc.) And it's reliance Amazon's os and apps (though if you use a lot of Amazon apps and products in your home already, then the tablet's value increases)",,,,

3,,"Best tablet under $100 I've bought! I've bought many different tablets that were under $100, and they were all so slow and bleh. The Fire HD 8 Plus is so quick and speedy, I mean WOW! I play games on it with no frame drops, quickly scroll and switch between apps with no lag.. It's insane how good this tablet is for the price. I'd honestly say it's the best tablet ever, simply because of that!I have just one complaint about it, and it's that the only app store available is the Amazon app store, which doesn't have some of the apps I use from the Google Play store on my phone (Like Snapchat, Google Voice, Cash App) but it does have a lot of them, and I don't really mind not having them ALL on my tablet.The Amazon App store is great, there are thousands of apps in it. Just don't expect it to have every single one you use on your phone!",,,
4,,Nice tablet Have had multiple kindles and this one is excellent,,,
5,,"Surprisingly better than my old Kindle Fire 8 I was not sure what to expect from this as upgrades on Kindle devices tend to be very minor, but this time it was a significant increase in response time and functionality. I upgraded from the 7th generation to this 10th generation and I'm very impressed with it so far.Positives:* Noticeably more responsive (faster processing) than my 7th gen.* More built-in storage (adding a memory card is possible, but in my experience this slows the boot time significantly, at least on my other Fire tablets)* Screen - this tablet seems to have a somewhat sharper, clearer, and brighter screen than my 7th gen Fire 8Neutral:* Change in device size - it's annoying to have to buy a new case each time I change devices, but I suppose that's the same for all devices these days, so it's not fair to ding Amazon for something that everyone does.* Color options - I'm kind of tired of black devices, to be honest. I upgraded my 2013 Paperwhite recently simply because of the Sage color option, which admittedly is hidden if you put it in a case, but I still prefer having color options.Negatives:* Like previous tablets, adding a memory card seems to slow the device, especially at boot time. My old 7th gen Fire 8 was slower than my old Fire 7 (2015) with a 32Gb memory card installed, both in boot time and while running. This tablet does not seem to take as much of a performance hit, but it still is impacted. I'd like to be able to have the same speed with or without additional storage.Why did I upgrade? Well, it was Prime Day and I could get a small amount of money and a reasonable discount by trading in my old device (like new, despite being well used) and with the Prime Day discount piled on top of that, I got what I thought was a good deal for a tablet that had more RAM, a slightly more powerful processor, and enough storage to not need to add more.Was it worth it? Overall I would say yes, it was, but I'm not sure that I would have upgraded without the incentives. My 7th gen Fire was just fine, especially without the additional memory card installed, but with the discounts it seemed like it would be worth a chance. 5 years, after all, is getting into the early stages of old age for technology. It would have been an easier decision to upgrade if I could have gotten that nice Sage green, but I got a sage case and that's good enough for the next 5 years or so.",,,
6,"Spring for the plus. You're probably asking yourself right now how much better could the plus really be? Is it worth the extra $__ just to have 1 more gig of ram when the processors are the same?Ahhhhhahahahahahaha, you fool!Get the plus. I just traded in my basic Fire 8 HD and I'm honestly all kind of bitter now having realized I put up with that keyboard for as long as I did, I had no idea how much better this was going to be. The keyboard on the lesser models just becomes completely unusable after so many updates. I didn't even realize there was an alternative to waiting 5 minutes for the home page to load. It's like a real tablet now, and not an etch-e-sketch. Finally, I won't be already be long finished in the bathroom by the time the tablet stops lagging.",,,,
7,,"Much better than previous versions This 2020 version is so much faster and easier to use than the model I had that was about 4 years old.  It switches easily from show mode to regular mode just by saying Alexa, close show mode.  Changing screens and webpages is almost as fast as my ipad.  I have the 12.9 "" Ipad pro but I love this 8"" Fire HD because it's easier to hold and carry in my handbag.",,,
8,"A portable Echo Show - You get what you pay for, but that’s not a bad thing. Liked:- Great for the use I got it for, entertainment. I can watch my shows with good quality (I’d prefer to have the smaller screen if it means better quality).- Sound is decent, no issues yet. Pairs with AirPods or Bluetooth headphones if needed.- I have basic gaming apps that I use and they seem to be just fine.- The Show mode is nice but I haven’t fully utilized it yet as much as I thought I would. I just need to sit down and get my settings figured out.- It has a bed time mode where the screen darkens and takes on a yellow tint which is nice. When on show mode it even darkens the screen with just a dim time so  it’s nothing obtrusive in the bedroom.- The battery life seems to be pretty good. I can binge for quite a while on some Netflix without  worrying about charging. I got a wireless charging stand that was recommended when I was purchasing it. I keep on my nightstand and can use it when low on battery and as a sturdy stand even when not needed for charging. Highly recommend. Especially if you’re wanting to utilize the tablet as an echo show.- I haven’t used it for reading so much but I don’t expect too many issues if any.Disliked:- it’s not very useful for productivity stuff like MS Office, email, etc- App Store: there’s some apps that you only get weird links to the internet (google apps is what I tried) they still give you shortcut buttons though so that’s something- When I have the case on it I always seem to accidentally hit the main button on the side, an annoyance rather than an issue.- There was an issue when I asked Alexa what the date was and she beeped but didn’t respond but not sure what that’s about.Notes:- I got the add free version so I’m not sure what it’s like without the add free version- I recommend getting the case recommended for sure and a screen protector for your own sake. Extras that are nicer but not as necessary are the wireless charging stand (see above note) and an SD card. I went ahead and got an extra SD card and instillation was easy enough and it walks you through when installed on what you want to use it for (photo storage or tablet memory)- You can have it where it automatically goes to show mode when you put it on wireless charging, but you can change that feature how you want it as well.",,,,

My cell phone has better sound volume and quality. I've had many tablets, this being my least favorite.",,,,
2,"Average tablet for a great price Let's not fool ourselves with the capabilities of this device.  The Amazon app store is seriously limited in its app selection.  Installing the Google Play store is needed to make this tablet useful, requiring a hack, but the hack's difficulty is fairly easy.  By today's standards, the tablet is slow switching between apps due to its limited memory and processing power.  This is okay if you are not switching much with the apps you use, such as using a web browser or video streaming for long periods of time.  The video resolution is DVD-quality but not full HD, which limits the usefulness of Blu-Ray quality full HD movies.  The tablet is perpetually stuck in Android 9 and Amazon, while they release security updates for their tablets, never upgrades the Android version for them.But if you're like me and mainly use this to read news and read pages on the web, this works well.  I prefer the 1.6:1 aspect ratio of these Android tablets to iPad's 1.33:1 aspect.  The 1.33:1 aspect is supposed to come close the size of a magazine page, but I prefer to read pages like it's a big phone rather than to emulate paper.  If you prefer something that emulates a paper then get the iPad instead, which certainly will be faster and more capable, but be prepared to spend more money.The USB-C connector and wireless charging are nice touches.  I refused to buy another Fire tablet until they came with USB-C; it's ridiculous that it took them until 2020 to equip the 8-inch tablets with the USB-C connector.Overall I'm satisfied with the tablet with the Google Play modification, but it's certainly nothing snazzy.",,,,
3,"Great, but beware for children use I purchased two these for my daughters, 10 and 12 years old. Although the features of these devices are great, very fast and responsive, nice screen and sensitivity, the only complaint I have is that I haven't found out a way to allow for internet use with a type of ""safe search"" filter. Unless I am missing something, the only way I see to block ""adult"" websites is to disable the web on the device, and if your kid wants to download something, you need to put the parental code in to allow it, each time. I wish there was a setting that just blocked adult content websites, especially like porn. I was really surprised when I applied parental controls, indicated the device was for a child, then enabled the internet on the device and typed in a pornographic web address and the lewd, graphic images appeared on the device. Now, I just have the web disabled and approve each time one of the girls wants to access the web for a download or an application.  PS. Yes, I know there are new websites all the time, and there is no 100% foolproof way for it to be known what a website contains, but what I visited was likely a top 3 porn site, for I figured if this was accessible then likely all of them would be. Yes, I also know Amazon has a kindle for kids, but they had that before and I feel they are outgrowing the content of those Kindles, and I want to give them more freedom, but protect them at the same time. Had there been a way to enable a ""safe search"" on the device, the rating would be 5 stars all the way.",,,,
4,"Music app is garbage The music app only works part time on the 8 plus. It does not work on the new 7in fire, when I try to use it I get error try again every time. I downloaded some harp music from online music to  offline music. Later I downloaded some guitar music from online music to offline music, when I tried to play the harp music, the 8 plus wouldn't recognize the harp music. Now neither of my 8 fire pluses will download any thing from online music. So the music app will be garbage until the software is fixed!!!!!!!",,,,

7,,,,"Why do they keep downgrading these? My old HDX that I got back in 2012 or 2013 had a MUCH better screen. This thing is basically in 720p. The resolution is so low the text is all jagged and you can see each individual pixel easily. I want to say my HDX had a darn-near 2K screen on it, and that was 7-8 years ago. While I never liked Amazon's wanna-be-proprietary OS, I got used to it, and ended up loving that tablet. Now it's at the point where it doesn't hold a charge at all and I can't use it unless it's plugged in, shame.So I got this one and figured I'd start using Alexa, and start turning my apartment into a smart home (well as much as a renter would want to).As soon as I turned it on, I tried going into options, wondering why it was set at some weird low resolution... It's 2020 folks, get with the program. My crappy Chinese 6"" generic Android phone has a >1080p screen. Many people have 4k screens on their tablets and phones. Why is one of the richest companies on the planet putting out devices with 1990's screen resolution, and pretending it's ""new and upgraded""? If I'd known this, I would've never bought it. I just assumed it'd at least have a 1080p screen.Also, and this is the real kicker: I'm having major issues downloading videos I've purchased on Amazon Prime. It keeps trying to download movies, that I've ALREADY downloaded (not streamed, downloaded to the SD card after purchasing). They're already saved, and at 100%. Then I buy a new movie and instead of just downloading it, it says ""queued"", and it's basically waiting for another movie to finish downloading. I look and it's waiting on a movie I finished downloading over 24 hours ago (and is sitting at 100% completion).So I click on the movie that's still trying to download (even though it's finished), and hit ""cancel download"", so I can move on to my next one (I have a 1TB SD card, and I'm trying to load it up with movies and stuff for road trips, or times when the house's internet connection goes down). Instead of just canceling the download IT DELETES THE ENTIRE MOVIE.I say ""ok, that's really dumb, I'll try again later"". I move on to the movie I just purchased, and hit download, and it's just sitting there at 0%. My internet connection is fine. I'm able to browse the internet using the kindle, etc. I have my VPN turned off (just in case), the ""killswitch"" is disabled, etc. I've fully updated the tablet (automatically installed 1 large update when I first got it, then manually installed 14 little ones).I think, ""ok, maybe I'll just restart the device and see if that clears things up"".It just says ""restarting"" for 10 mins straight. Stuck. I had to hold the power button down forever and force it. I come back online and try to download the movie again. Instead of downloading it says ""queued"" again.... And now it's trying to complete a totally different movie THAT WAS ALSO ALREADY FINISHED DOWNLOADING.I did it all again. Lost another completed movie. This time after rebooting, it's trying to download a movie I never bought, and never even clicked on (Gemini Man). WHAT THE HELL??!?!?? I don't have unlimited data on my home's internet plan. They cut me off after 1TB/mo (and at this rate, I'm actually going to run out for once), or start charging an absurd amout for 10gb blocks after that.How is it that a ""new"" device MADE BY AMAZON, can't download movies SOLD ON AMAZON PRIME?!?! I'm not using any weird 3rd party stuff that one would think might cause a compatibility problem. Why is it just kind of ""doing whatever it wants"" by downloading movies I had no interest in? I seriously doubt I used my pass code to unlock the screen, and downloaded the movie in my sleep.This is a brand new device with a brand new memory card. I'm already getting ready to just use it for target practice for my new AR-15 (at least that thing works).Do yourselves a favor. Buy a cheap Chinese tablet and just install Alexa on it (if that's why you're looking at Kindles). I wish I had. That's all Amazon is doing with these, then slapping their logo on it, and charging similar prices for something with MUCH WORSE hardware in it ...and you have to jump through extra hoops just to get Google on it. Ridiculous.This thing is garbage, and they really should be ashamed. I *REALLY* got taken for a ride too: bought the wireless charging stand, and a case, paid extra for the ad-free version, got the full 1tb memory card etc. So I'm not just wasting the cost of the tablet. Lesson learned.I should just send it back, but I'm unsure of just how much of my data might remain after doing a factory reset, my trust in them isn't very high right now. I've also got my ""smart lights"" and security cameras all set up to work with this, too. I really don't want to have to go through all that again with a new device...Unless you're say: buying this for a grandparent who's never had ANY other tablet before, I'd STRONGLY recommend getting something else.",

The price was so low I didn't expect much but it performs well and the screen is bright and clear.  I only use it to play a few simple games (available through the Amazon app) and to look something up on the internet occasionally without having to pull out my laptop.  Some internet pages don't display properly but I discovered that if you reorient the tablet from landscape to portrait it's much better.  Response times are quick.  I was also able to easily add my gmail mailbox in order to check emails throughout the day.  This is a very basic tablet, but well worth the excellent price and is perfect for a non-techie person.  If you don't need a whole bunch of bells and whistles this is a great choice.",,,
2,"Best for Amazon but still not A+.  Great for the money, though. Amazon created a new market for tablets with their Fire Tablet line a while back, and generally they are hit-and-miss with consumers.  Some people love them for their cheap prices and basic abilities, while others are disappointed when finding out they are not true Android tablets, but run a side version of it based on Amazon's operating system (which does have limits in comparison).  I've tried a couple of the smaller 7 inch models in the past and I was very disappointed in them, finding them sluggish to the point of causing near insanity on my part.  These are not known for having top-tier internal components.  But then again, they are less expensive than many other tablet offerings out there.So, next generation it out, and there's a 8, and an 8-plus.  The short of it:  The 8-plus has a little more battery capacity, one extra gig of RAM (3 instead of the 2 on the regular version, which does make a bit of a difference in smooth operations), the ability to wirelessly charge, and faster charging with USB-C instead of micro-usb.  Both versions still have what I consider to be slightly sub-par screens (800 pixels wide instead of true 1080p, etc), and both have poor quality cameras (the 8-plus front camera is now on the side for easier video conferencing).  Both still use Amazon's proprietary app store which has the basics, but not everything you'd find in Android.  Both are a bit slow to download/update apps, boot up, etc.Who do I think this is for?  This is a tablet for ""Amazon use"".  You would get this primarily if you are an Amazon Prime member, and you're going to use it for shopping, reading e-books, watching Amazon Prime shows and movies, and video chatting with other members, and you don't want to spend a ton of money.  If you want a ""full"" Android tablet experience, look elsewhere (and of course, be ready to pay a bit more), and certainly do not try to compare it to an iPad.  This is what it is - it's a cheap tablet catering to very specific things, and as long as those are the things you are buying it for, you should be happy with it.  I do think the ""plus"" is worth the few extra dollars though for the upgrades it has over the regular model 8.",,,,

5,,"BEST BUDGET TABLET FOR THE MONEY(now fix the screen....please) This is the best Fire tablet that I've every owned .I have owned every one but the none plus new HD8 and the 2019 HD10. This is a solid upgrade. I just wish the screen would have been upgraded as well. That would have taken this table from great to fantastic,but I am very happy with great. All in all the screen is better than most budget tables in and above this price point. Amazon Prime,Netflix and others look very good on this 8 inch device. Reading books and web pages all look crisp for my taste. I was able to read and watch movies for hours with the long battery life this update brings. I hope the next upgrade brings a better screen.As for what makes it great,it's all in the ram upgrade and optimization of the cpu. The Mediatek processor are finding their place in many more devices today. Their performance on all the Fire device has continued to get better and the 3GB of ram helps on the HD8+. I am not much of a gamer at all but,I can see the difference from my old HD8 . To me it's day and night with the game mode and the ram management. This tablet has become my go to device now. It's a must if you are a Prime member for downloading video for on the road. I have the 64GB device with a 256GB SD card so I can have movies and music for days.UpdateWell after 5 more months with this device. I am adding a star. I added the star because after a few more updates from Amazon the overall performance has gotten much better. I also installed a screen protector that also helps with the glare  from sunlight and room lights as wel. I still hope the next model to 1080l,at least but this is a fine budget tablet. While I'm still not much of a gamer I've been playing Call of Duty  and Asphalt 8 and others with very little, to no lag. The Show Mode option is great for my bedside.I have to say that instaaing the Google Play Store was easy and I feel its a must do. Out of the box the Amazon App Store has a nice amount of apps that should be best optimized for tables. The tablet at it's core is still Android, which just goes better with pure Google apps.. I left my old Fire HD with just the Amazon App Store to compare.",,,
6,,"2020 10th Gen. Firetablet 8+ 64gb (No Ads-option.) Greetings. About this tablet. I purchased this tablet, for a couple of reasons. 1st, I just wanted an mp3 player with sd card capabilities. And 2nd, a larger screen. Ive had a player from a manufacture from california for a while. Ive also gotten heavily invested into their ecosystem. However due to updates to their OS. Features from my mp3, managing playlists etc, were made obsolete. So, I began looking abroad. Their are a ton of mp3 players on the market. However, either the hi-res audio features, dont work via bluetooth, headphones, speakers etc. Or the battery life drops to 60% jus making a playlist, after a full charge. And many are small/ tiny and the makers, try to load features like web browsen, emails etc.. and the cost of the name brands ones are starting, at around $200 plus. With tht being said. I just wanted a device, tht could handle my mp3 audio, and 2nd, sd card capabilities. As Ive never saved music to sd cards and I wanted to check it out. The fire tablet 8+ so far? Has been a great investment. Not only can you continually update your saved/purchsed mp3 audio files. But the sd card reader for this particular model, 64gb/no adds version, can be loaded to 1TB. (No I'm not planning on loading tht much music but tht is what it is capable of.) You can also watch movies from various platforms-via wifi. And also you can save those movies to a sd card for later viewing. And Yeh, check your emails etc. I dont currently have a need for tht. But it is good to know, I have the option for set up. It also it travels well. Battery life is alttle better than advertised. Of course, I use this tablet mostly for audio purposes, and now entertainment.  Bluetooth, 5.0 le. I have bose speakers and earphones connected and they sound through out my home. No drop offs. The Kindle/audiable features are also great to have. The apps are pre loaded, and if your a prime member? Its a easy set up. SD cards? Id purchase from a known supplier. And do your own leg work on it. For the reason, not everyone needs fast speeds or large capacities. Thts a part of why this is great. Finally, its a great product. And is meeting my needs. DJ Colo.",,,
7,"A good all around tablet. Got this for a great price during a “fire sale” and for the discounted cost, it’s a well made tablet that lets me read in my kindle app and shop Amazon with no problems. Watching prime video or internet surfing when traveling is another plus for me. Just remember that it’s simple so if you’re expecting iPad resolution and performance, you’ll be disappointed. Like how you can add additional space with micro sd so you really don’t need to get the one with more gb. An essential item for Prime Members. Maybe get the 10 when another sale comes along. Bigger screen would be nice.",,,,

But my husband is not a reader and I was keeping him up at night with the light, the book and the whole set up. I bought this for myself as a birthday gift and am already in love with it.

0,,,"Not FAST and RESPONSIVE as advertised. Limited app capablilty! I am not sure as to what ""fast and responsive"" means to the marketing team at Amazon, but their definition is not at all what mine is. I would characterize the HD 8 plus as mediocre at best. It is a fine tablet for what I use it for, but the lack of google playstore (expected) and only the amazon fire app store is extremely limiting! I cannot use the tablet to it's full (albeit slow) potential as a result. I can less than a third of what I had hoped to do. Interestingly a Samsung or any android device for that matter (other than amazon fire devices) can do exactly what I want and or need; Precisely! I would suggest Amazon simply remove the add function, charge more and add the google playstore to their devices. In fact, I would welcome the Amazon apps to any android device such as ""show mode""! Package the apps Amazon. I tried the Fire 7 years ago and was unhappy then. I have now tried the HD 8 Plus years later (2 in fact with wireless charging) and I am again unimpressed. Until the Fire devices are true android and support the inclusion (out of the box) google play store... this is my very last purchase of fire tablet products. The limitations are just far too pronounced. Sorry Amazon, there are better choices for tablets in the droves, and this is not competitive (other than price). That is my two-cents anyway. I really suggest spending more and getting a fully functional device. These are cheap, and that is undisputed (especially at the Black Friday prices) but it feels more like a demo tablet than an actual product. I literally struggled to find ANY app I wanted on the Fire store. I know what I like, what I want, and what I am comfortable with... this is not it. I am aware that Amazon is going to ignore the google store situation, for good marketing reason; people like me still purchased it, even knowing full well it would not be a great experience. Why do we do that? It only encourages Amazon to continue making extremely limited devices. I NEED another true android device (phone or tablet) to compliment this tablet to do everything I need/want done... how is that even a buy?  I don't even need this tablet when that is the case.  Amazons app store is not at all even slightly on par with googles, and other than Amazon apps branded apps... nothing is ""special"" or different other than lacking tons of content/apps. I give up understanding. I was guilty of the purchase as much as those that made it this way. If you only want a show that you can hold in your hand and surf the web using the silk browser (and don't mind it being very slow in doing so) than this is for you. Otherwise..... ???",,
1,,,"Great for rhe price I got it for! I bought it for 50% off, so for the price, it's an excellent deal. However, I also needed to download some important investment reading material in the form of pdf files. Also, it won't allow me to download my investment apps. This fire tablet is restrictive of that. It is made for entertainment purposes only. It would've been better for me to spend more to have an all in one but hey, couldn't beat the price with a 3 feet pole.",,
2,"Good Product for the Price. The price is very good especially I bought on Black Friday.  But the HD8"" PLUS (10th. generation 2020) has not improved much from the HD8"" (8th. generation 2018) that I was using.Most disappointed is the speaker VOLUME, it's still  too low about same as HD8"" (8th. generation 2018).Even if I have very good hearing and usually don't like loud music, but the sound is just OK when in the  room and outside are quiet.  If an AC is turned on in the room, even the maximum volume is barely enough when I watch movie or video.Second thing is the WiFi connection, weak reception.  Also about same as 8th. generation 2018.Third thing is power button position, Amazon changed it from far right to left next to volume controls.  That just makes it worse, inconvenient and easily press power button by mistake when you want to adjust volume.I had a Fire HD7"" (4th. generation, NOT Fire 7"") from my friend many years ago.  (Maybe it's a special edition, never see on market in stores or online.)  It's much better than HD 8 or HD 8 plus almost on everything even though it's smaller and a few generations older.  I was actually amazed that HD 7"" so tiny two speakers could produce so loud beutiful stereo sound than HD 8"" we have today.I really don't understand why Amazon can't make new Fire tablets as good as old Fire HD 7"" if not better.  I do understand Amazon takes low cost strategy to target on that potion of tablet market.  But they can make a standard version and higher version to suit different customers.I don't want Apple tablet which not only expensive but different operating system.  Samsung is also a joke that they don't make HD 8"" tablet and have only one speaker even up to this date.  It's disappointing I could not find a HD 8"" tablet just as good as the Fire HD 7"".That said still my Fire HD 8"" plus is a good purchase overall.  Just not good enough, I wish Amazon could make a better one even if that mean a little more expensive, and I am willing to pay more.",,,,

4,,"Worth The Price I went from a Kindle Fire purchased in 2011 to this new model #8.  It was a learning curve, but now that I have gotten used to it, I love it.  The colors are sharp and the battery life is awesome!  It is also charges quickly so I do not have to wait for hours for it to fully charge.",,,
5,"An Upgrade for Sure I think the biggest appeal of the 2020 HD8 ""plus"" model is that it does indeed have a little extra horsepower under the hood from the last model. The touchscreen and loading times all feel that tiny bit more ""snappy"" thanks to legitimate hardware upgrades. But the thing that subtly impressed me the most was that it didn't run as warm as the 2018 model I started with. This isn't a game changer, but when it came to the more demanding games and apps I could always feel my 2018 model warm up quite a bit... Not so much here with fancy schmancy ""slate"" HD8 Plus. I thought that was worth pointing out as it was a non-advertised upgrade.Overall though, it's just the boring natural, or expected, update. Nothing groundbreaking. It's still in the same category it was before but just keeping up with Father Time. Tech Father Time definitely ticks faster, but the updates here keep pace with the HD8's slot among tablets. There's nothing to praise here beyond the price and that Amazon is keeping it relevant to the times. You want cheap, you get cheap. That isn't a bad thing at all, but one should be aware of it.I think the biggest missed opportunity and literal sideways step was the screen visuals. The 2020 screen is identical to the 2018 screen. No improvements. No resolution changes. Just the same old thing you were looking at before. Which is a shame, because I think the resolution was a weak point with the HD8 to begin with. And another model upgrade later staying the same? It makes it worse! Also for the nitpicky, it is ""only"" Wi-Fi 5 (ac). Which is an upgrade over the 2018 model that had Wi-Fi 4 (n), but Wi-Fi 6 (ax) is out now so it would have been nice. The vast vast vast majority of users won't ever notice this, or need to know it. But just throwin' it out there.End of the day you can't beat the bargain of Amazon tablets. Especially if you're already in the Amazon ecosystem elsewhere (Fire TV, etc). And then considering the loopholes one can easily find online for expanding the tablet's options, namely adding the Google Play Store? Well, it really is a bargain. This is a bargain tablet and you get what you pay for, but in a lot of scenarios that's quite alright. Go for it!",,,,

8,"A Great Little Tablet This tablet is a replacement of a Kindle Fire 7 that never met my needs as multimedia device.  I am completely happy with the size and quality of the HD 8 tablet.  I am able to use it with my Outlook and other Microsoft apps, as well as any video content I choose.  The screen is very good quality, and the sound is good, although I listen to it primarily with headphones or earbuds.  I prefer the 8"" screen size.  I consider any lag as minimal and its suits all of my needs, whether as a Kindle reader, e-mail consumption or video device.  I don't use it much for internet browsing, other than links in my e-mails, and it performs adequately.Overall, this is a major upgrade from the Fire 7, as the Fire 7 was extremely laggy and was frustratingly slow even when all of except the basic apps were on the device.  Also, the Fire 8 HD will properly go to sleep when used with the associated hinged cover whereas the Fire 7 would not go into a sleep mode properly and required constant charging.  I received the $20 trade in for the Fire 7 which provided me an avenue to get some money back and reduce my electronic devices.",,,,

0,"UPDATE! Fair is fair. No longer ""Random Screen Locks"" The case was the culprit Update Mach 31, 2021:Fair is fair and I must say this time was all the user's ""fault"". Unintentionally, mind you. I always aim to protect either tablets or phones I purchase immediately with cases or covers etc. When I got this tablet it seemed at first to be doing fine, then all of a sudden the screen started to present random locks. It was very hard to know the real cause, but I was determined, reminded as I grabbed it, unlocked it an locked itself back again!!??. Well, long story short I tested and tested until I came to the conclusion that the culprit was in fact the case. It seems like the magnet used for the sleep/wake function, which I love, is strong enough to activate the lock screen function when the folio case is folded flat against the back of the tablet. It's relatively easy to recreate the flaw, it's definitely there and it happens at very specific positions. I like the case so I'm keeping it, the case in fact came free the purchase of the tablet, all this through a different vendor, not Amazon, it was a special promotion at a very good price. I recommend this tablet, it's ay faster than its bigger sibling, the latest fire 10 inch. The battery life is another aspect I'm super impressed with. I have left the tablet unused for several weeks and it keeps a good charge and remains responsive. I must say that all this fire tablets struggle a little when switching profiles. When my son has used the tablet for ""free time"" then I switch to my profile, it stutters a bit. Other than that this is a great tablet for its size and specially the price with the features it's been paired with.------I must say this tablet performs OK, except when it doesn’t. Sometimes when I’m doing something all of a sudden the screen locks, often, or it turns off (couple of occasions). I have no idea whether this is a recurrent issue for this model or maybe I got a lemon. I’ll keep using it it and will update the review (also I haven’t reached out yet to CS).",,,,

5,"A very ADEQUATE tablet I bought this mostly for reading books since I get eyestrain reading on my phone and it's hard to read in the daylight. The iPad mini was on the short list but I was waiting for the 6th version but then I saw this tablet on sale so I thought, ok, practically 1/5 the cost, why not? I'm glad I did! The ipad would have been over kill for me. This does what I need and does it well enough.Pros:-Well constructed-Good looking tablet-Wireless charging and pretty fast too-8"" screen for me is a great size for reading, doesn't feel cramped-Adequate performance for surfing, light gaming, very good performance for reading-Amazon integration if you like that and built in Alexa though my preference is the Google assistantCons:-plastic shell and screen scratches easily though they're light, you need to get a case and screen protector-not enough ram even for the plus variant. apps will close-only two types of unlock methods, password and pin, this is the most annoying. The tablet needs a finger print scanner and/or pattern lock.-it's on Android 9 though with an Amazon skin on it.-unfortunately it is hard to read in the daylight, needs more nits!-not sure why, may be the low ram but surfing gets slower over time-Sound could be better-physical button placement. I think Amazon intends for landscape but for reading I prefer portrait and it fits in one hand. Amazon should think about haptic feedback to wake the table up or for software options for power and volume. It has a software option for volume control but it only appears if you click on the volume up or down buttons.Hopefully Amazon will take note of some of my suggestions. I did buy an additional micro SD card and Amazon detected and configured it automatically, excellent! Since it is larger than your phone I'm hoping to find some carrier with a neck strap.",,,,
6,,"Fire 8 HD Plus- Superior Super Quick Tablet!! Wow>Read on- I am a gadget geek & have owned Apple I-pads; Android Tablets, and other Kindles. Amazon fire kindles have great Processors that are Superior to high end expensive Tablets and the Kindle processor is often much Quicker. The gen 5/7 kindles had a mini USB charging port that would often go bad after awhile. On this new fire 8 HD plus they upgraded to a USB-C charging port which is much better then the mini USB Port and shouldn't give anyone issues. The fire 8 hd plus is Super Quick;it has 3GB's of Ram which is great for gaming and watching movies, the Fire 8 hd plus in my opinion is the Best Gaming/movie watching Tablet on the market!! I have read the Negative reviews and have absolutely no clue what they are talking about! Another thing this Fire 8 hd plus has is Dual Band for internet connection. So most devices; Cell phones, Tablets, ect. are single band that run on 2.0 Ghz, This fire 8 hd plus is Dual band, so it will run on 2.0 GHz or 5.0 GHz!!! The Kindle 8 hd plus is already super quick, with the 5.0 GHz it really makes this Fire Kindle 8 hd the most Superior tablet on the market!!! Also; once you put Google Playstore on this  Device, you've now turned a $100 Device into a $1,000 Device!!! If you do put playstore on this device make sure the 4 playstore links are based off of Android 9.0 because the OS version on these tabs are based off Android 9.0. So what others failed to mention is This Tablet has a Upgraded USB-C Port(huge); 3GB of Ram, its Dual band, and you can expand the SD Storage card up to 1 TB!!! Again I have owned many tabs in the past because I'm a gadget geek, and I can't find anything on the market that is better then this!!! Do not hesitate,  Buy it!!! I would give it 10 stars if I  could! Stick with this model for gaming/watching movies; Do not go up to the 10.1 inch Tabs, often they are horrible for gaming,  and the 10.1 inch tab only has 2 GB's of ram, and the Fire 8 hd plus has 3 GB of Ram, that extra 1 GB is Huge!!!! Buy it!!!",,,
7,"You get what you pay for. The tablet is small; I thought it might be a tad larger. It works in a pinch if you don't want to lug around a large laptop and you are a student and can't afford a real tablet. Nonetheless, I got the plus thinking it would be faster, and it's not really. However, I can still use it for school if I'm not writing a long thesis. Depending on what you are purchasing it for, it's excellent, but as I said, you get what you pay for. It would be great for young kids under 12 for games and reading. Also, the negative is that several apps you may have on your phone or laptop can't be loaded onto it. Yet I like that it comes with a charging stand and goes into show mode so I can watch videos. I signed up for prime for one week, then attempted to sign up for student Prime benefits and was unable, so I canceled.",,,,
8,"in total very good - a couple changes that I don't like I can't say that I'm truly unhappy with this new version, but a couple things do bother me.  I already had an HD8 - 6th edition; i like that very much.  I bought the newer version because my old one was getting cranky & it its the only way I can access the DUO app I need for work-from-home (we are still at that point in my company & there is talk of going permanent with it).Not surprisingly, the size is different so as to require purchase of new accessories, but that isn't a big issue.My biggest complaint is the location of the side buttons - the ""power"" and up/down buttons are now right next to each other, instead of on opposite ends of the same side.  Their new proximity makes them frustrating to use - no longer easy to do so without having to pay attention; very easy to hit the wrong one.After that, I dislike the change in function of the wifi icon in the message center (swipe down from top).  it merely turns on & off the wifi, instead of having the ability to easily switch between networks like previously.  On my older tablet, it would be an on button if already off, but when on, would give me a drop down of available networks - then I could simply touch the one i wanted.  With the new button, to switch networks requires going into settings & even then it is not a simple click to switch.  I find this to be rather annoying.My last point is merely aesthetic:  the icons at the bottom (arrow, circle, square) are now filled in & not just outlines.  i don't like them this way.None of these are enough to make me wish I had made a different purchase, just things I wanted to point out to others.i do plan do get the same new tablet for my husband on Prime Day(s) coming up - he's got an HD8 7th generation.  It will be interesting to see if the same things bother him.  (Although it is less likely; he's a guy, first off & he only uses his at home, whereas I take mine everywhere)",,,,
9,,"Best deal ever for very good tablet... I got it on sale for $55 (new!) with a $10 gift card. I stuck a $15 microSD card (128 GB) in it and sideloaded Play Store (easy if you find the right online directions and read them twice to make sure you understand). And voila! I ended up with a very usable, quick, and ridiculously inexpensive mini-tab. I'm a reasonably tech savvy person, and understand that most of the silly specs on the expensive devices don't add anything significant. The important features are build quality, battery life, and speed. The HD 8 Plus is excellent in all these areas without being overdone, and access to the Play Store makes the meager Amazon app store a non-issue. The resolution of the Apple devices is better, but you can't see it with your eyes. Batter life is over 10 hours watching a reasonably compressed bunch of movies, and the touch screen works just fine. Apple cameras are much better, but how often do you use a mini tab for a camera? The 3Gb RAM and new procesor make it fast enough for all but the most demanding video games - and who plays big games on a mini tab anyway. The Fire OS doesn't have quite the tweakability of stock Android, but I've found that - like all OS's - you get used to them and find the strong/weak points and workarounds after a few days, so that it doesn't just work... it works in ways that you want it to in almost every way). Bottom line: I'd have been happy at the usual $100 or so price point, but the sale price made it compelling.",,,

3,"Surprisingly Capable & Readable Light-Weight! Mine seemed a little rough around the edges at first (or was that just me?). It would occasionally emit random or squelched noises and book pages would lock up.  That last was easy to fix when I closed down some open apps.  But on the whole, it is a terrific buy for the price. As a book-reader, it is great with multicolor highlights that look bright and attention-getting on the screen.  I initially invested in the device to read my Washington Post. It is big enough for the paper to be more legible than it is on my Fire HD-6 and light enough to be more easy to hold than my Fire HD-8.9. So in that regard, my expectations were more than satisfied.  Though I paid extra to take the adds off my lock screen, many if not all screens are covered with recommendations: books, magazines, apps, videos, and music from Amazon.  At least twice, I downloaded apps from the Amazon App Store that responded during installation: “This app requires Google Services and will not run on your device!”  An example would be the superb weather app, “Dark Sky.”  I was disappointed!  I hasten to add that my Netflix App works like a charm. I was stunned that a screen with such a modest DPI could still be so clear for both reading books and viewing media.  I bought the device holder/wireless charger and that is a marvel! It can charge my new kindle surprisingly fast either in or out of the Amazon case and either vertically or horizontally. I have some arthritis on my hands so that “stand” is a blessing! My only suggestion would be that it be able to fold flat for travel.  For those who literally spend hours every day reading, I recommend investing in keeping a Kindle Paperwhite, a superb e-reader, close at hand and ready to synch. But for those who want a multi-functional gateway to Amazon media with 3 gig of RAM and wireless charging, the Fire HD-8 Plus (especially on sale for Christmas) is a great choice!",,,,

It's not the greatest tablet on the market, but if you need something that's a bit beyond basic and can keep your entertained then it's perfectly fine.The Echo Show mode is useful as well.I don't understand why there are only two wake words for the device; Alexa and Amazon, since those are the two that gets used a lot on TV and videos and it responds when it's said by anything.

6,,"Great budget tablet I bought this tablet primarily to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab A (8 inch) tablet with which I was displeased, primarily because it was so slow. I don't have any specific metrics or benchmarks, but it was just slow - loading up apps, loading websites, and especially task switching. My uneducated guess is that the problem was that it only had 2 GB of RAM. It probably needed more.So when I looked into this Fire tablet, I was careful to get the model with 3 GB of RAM. I figured that if my uneducated guess about the RAM was wrong, I could just return the Fire. However, it turns out that the Fire's performance far exceeds that of the Samsung, at least according to my subjective benchmarks. I'm very satisfied with it.To literally ""replace"" my Samsung tablet, the Fire needed a little help, because many of the apps I use are not available in the Amazon app store (LastPass and Cheftap are two specific examples; there are many more). So I did a bit of googling and found out how to install the Google Play store, and then I used the Play store to install any apps I need that aren't in the Amazon store. This was done *without* rooting the Fire.  The challenge is that the Fire's OS is based on an older version of Android, so you have to get a Play store that matches the older Android version. That *could* limit the ability to get app upgrades of certain apps, but for now I haven't encountered that problem.I did get the version with ads on the lock screen. That saves some bucks and is entirely unobtrusive, in my opinion.The Fire charges up with the newer USB-C plug; some day all non-Apple devices will do that and life will be happy across all the land.",,,

8,"Awesome Starter Tablet, Personal Assistant, and Portable Entertainment Screen I've owned the Fire HD 8 for ~ 6 months now. Before I explain why, let me say that I do recommend this tablet; to anyone. I was drawn to this tablet solely by its price. Purchasing low-end has worked well for me.With less than perfect vision, I often yearned for something larger than my smartphone to browse the web, read the news, and read books for extended periods of time.Regarding the app store, the app selection is scarce. The most disappointing aspect of that is the lack of an alternative browser to Silk. Firefox is definitely preferred.Regarding the screen, its great for reading, good for media.Regarding the processor, its very disappointing. Its drawbacks are most obvious when using media apps, switching apps or any other multi-tasking like behavior. Even with no power or connectivity restrictions set, nearly all notifications are delayed.Regarding the battery, it's awesome. (Especially with the convenience of the wireless dock) I've never ran below 20% battery.As far as my satisfaction with purchasing low-end; I feel no pressure to preserve the device. I purchased the screen protector and matching cover, which gives me ample comfort that my table is safe. I feel comfortable bringing it out in public in any sort of conditions without fear or loss or damage ... simply because it didn't cost me $1000. Because of that, I'm more likely to throw it in my bag or grab it alongside my keys, wallet, and phone on my way out of the door allowing me to use it more often and love it a little bit more.When I'm at home, and because of Alexa - and other basic apps and utilities - this tablet is a great companion. Again, because it didn't cost me $1000, I feel comfortable reading a book in a bubble bath. When the day is done, I can drop it on it's dock on my night stand, automatically activating ""show mode"" and the night stand clock.It doesn't get much better than that for less than $200.",,,,

0,,"Performs as expected. This review is for the HD8 Plus with no lock screen ads.Firstly, if you are looking for a flagship top of the line android tablet to run apps from Google Play Store, this is not it, look elsewhere. Now that we have that out of the way, this tablet delivers exactly what it promises, an awesome Amazon focused experience.I purchased this tablet as an upgrade to my aging Fire HD8. The first difference I noticed is the dimension, this newer tablet is wider than the previous version, that is because the camera is now along the longer side, not the shorter side as in the older model.  It feels different and while I personally prefer the narrower format, but I am getting used to it.Battery:Finally, it has a USB type-C connector, one less charger to carry around. You can use this to charge and transfer data to the tablet. Charging is not quick charge but for this tablet, I don’t need quick charge. Battery is just right, I use this tablet almost all-day playing music, browsing the web, YouTube, etc. and still have juice left at the end of the day.Speed:Performance is just right for this tablet, it handles anything I can throw at it, a marked improvement over my older HD8 (6th gen). Apps open with very little or no lag, nothing to complain about, it is just right.Storage:I added a 256GB Micro SD card for extra storage. This tablet can handle up to 1TB MicroSD cards. It is easy to add your own media, once connected to your computer, swipe down or go into settings and change the USB connection mode to allow file transfers, by default it’s charging only.Tip:You can disable the new items from showing on the home screen from settings, swipe down, settings, use the search bar (at the top) and enter “new”. Select “New Items on the Home page” and turn off “Show new items…”.Finally:Now if you really want to know, you can sideload the Play Store app. If you are following so far, you know where to go and how to find instructions, it takes just a few minutes and works very well.I skipped the last release and waited for this generation; I can say it was well worth the wait.P.S. I have not tested wireless charging or Show Mode as yet.",,,

2,,"The problem is NOT the tablet! I read a lot of reviews and honestly don't understand why all the issues. Yes the Google Play store is not available because this is not a Google made product!All those people complaining about wifi connectivity, maybe the problem isn't this tablet and more of an issue with your obsolete router or your slow ISP because your so cheap!Seriously, all these garbage reviews sound like someone just is doing something wrong or they need to spend some money and upgrade something else!I bought the 8+ with max specs, no ads, and I dont run the echo-show mode. I also bought the wireless charging stand.I have had no issues whatsoever, and I kind of push mine beyond lame web surfing blah blah blah.My main activity is running PUBG in max graphics mode and it runs excellent!Yes I also stream youtube, run the Amazon music app while connected by cast or bluetooth, again no problems!The screen display is just fine. I didn't buy for camera usage so no big deal there.I think the sound is fine for what I paid for and for those moments I want more, again I connect to my smart speaker or I make use of head phones, no brainer!I have not experienced any lag or slowing down of my system and I have owned for about 6 months now. It's still as fast as day one!I also stuck some velcro between the tablet and wireless charging dock because I do move to different points and I always want the base support. No battery issues to report either.In summary I feel that most negative reviews aren't so much the tablet but slow ISP or bad routers. Upgrade people!I have really enjoyed my tablet. It works fantastic and will provide me with years of boredom killing fun!I recommend this tablet, just modernize your internet equipment and make sure you have decent wifi speeds, you shouldn't have any problems.Peace out!",,,
3,"Vibrant large screen makes viewing print and photos a whole lot easier Large screen allows you to easily view any photos and print without having to enlarge for a better look. You don't need to have a Prime account but you will need at least a basic Amazon account to use the tablet. Colors come alive on the vibrant large touchscreen, which to some may be easier than a phone screen. What may be less than likable is downloading some apps; just know some are not free. You can use your tablet as an eReader which is pretty cool as well.More pros then cons with this purchase. Easy to use, simple to see, and feasible price.I would recommend.",,,,
4,"Nice upgrades for the price, great kids tablet upgrade. Needs 1080p to be perfect. On paper on Fire HD8 Plus is a pretty large update from the past two iterations of Amazon's most popular tablet and I think it delivers. It has TWICE the ram from the old 2016 model i'm replacing and I can actually multitask a little  bit without bogging the machine down. The 30% CPU bump along with the switch to Wireless AC has significantly cut through a lot of loading in regards to streaming content. I could be wrong but there appears to be some improvements in the speed of the read/write of the internet storage which which gives apps a much snappier launch time to my eye.There is also the switch over to the newer Fire OS which runs off new android software. I've noticed the new picture in picture mode, the *amazing* ability to finally pin apps for daughter to stay in her learning games. There's improvements to volume toggling and interface tweaks abound. It's not a huge departure from the older OS setup but all features are welcome.The tablet itself is denser, the buttons feel clickier without that cheap plastic feel of the old machines. USB-C itself means I can use my older phone chargers and laptop chargers and finally toss my last Micro-USB charger in my closet for good. The dual stereo speakers sound the same (as in very good for a  budget tablet), but the display is still too dim for my liking. Lots of people don't like the 800p display and it's true it's a bit grainy. But it also serves to keep battery life up and performance strong. It's the one sacrifice Amazon continues to make and I think it is a perfect compromise for kids content, but can be disappointing for adults who want to use it for reading text and browsing.In the end this is really going to be my kids tablet, with the new kids case attached to it. The lower pixel screen seems to fade away when the colorful simplistic kids content is displayed. I think this makes a huge upgrade for children on older Fire HD8 models and the extra ram is really useful when they are opening so many games, books and videos with Freetime. For adults? It will depend largely on how much you are willing to compromise on screen sharpness.",,,,
5,,"Great for the price I have a Fire 8HD and the major issue is that it does not work well with 5G. The Fire 8HD Plus works with 5G, I have had no drops or disconnects. It is faster and the colors seem brighter. The major differences are:(1) the position of the front camera - now on the side when held vertical. This in not an issue for me. I do not do face-to-face calls unless I am on my computer.(2) Size the Fire 8HD plus is shorter and wider then the old Fire8HD. It is 1/4 inch wider and 3/4 inches shorts. this means holding in you hand is not as secure. I could fold my fingers around the old Fire but cannot fold them around the new Fire Plus. It is not as secure and this is with out a case. Will not like walking in the airport caring this in my hand - afraid I will drop it if hit in a crowd - Yes I know we are to be social distancing.(3) power button is moved from the right side to now being next to the volume button. This is taking some adjustment and getting use to. I have a tendency to hit the volume button after first having tried to power on via the right side.(4) Still cannot load Google apps without some special technical doings which I am not ready to try.LIKES: speed is faster, more memory and storage, Still can add the micro-SD card, heading jacket, and the price is great for the features. I had 2 iPad and gave them to my grand-kids as they were problems when in China. Have a 8"" Lenovo tablet which still use.One major feature is Kindle books. I love to read and with the Cov19 I am reading about 1 book a day and now I use the Fire8 Plus instead of my Kindle paperwhite because I get more screen and I can adjust to a larger print. Will give my Kindle away as the Fire 8Plus is a better. I also like the USB 3 charger as it works with my Pixel3aIt is definitely worth the extra money but I would have liked if they had kept it the same size as the old Fire",,,
6,,"My last Fire I admit it, I'm a Fire junkie.  This is my third Fire 8 HD and my fifth over all, I previously had two Fire 7's.  The price is great, though I did go for the 1 TB chip which cost more than the tablet, charging stand and case combined, but that's another story.This is the first Fire to allow access to all of the Micro SD cards memory.  All of the others used a considerable chunk of that memory for who knows what.  After inserting the chip, I had 1TB of memory available from the start.  My previous Fire, the eighth generation, only had 364 GB of the 400 GB chip available.  After downloading over five hundred books and 89 HD movies, I still have over eight hundred GB available.Back to the Fire tablet.  It's faster than the preceding version with more base memory.I think this one is the cure to my Fire addiction, I don't think I'll need to upgrade again.  But I'm sure all the I phone users have said the same thing.Update: 7/31/2020I have a nasty habit of reading reviews submitted on products I own.  It baffles me why some of the reviewers seem obliged to bad mouth a product because they didn't properly research the item before purchase.The specs on the Fire HD8 Plus were clearly displayed and the image showed that the front camera had been moved from the top to the side, hence the need for a different case.Mine was a pre-order and I received it on the first available date.  It was in perfect condition.  As stated above, I've had four Fire tablets before this one and I've not been disappointed with any of them.  The biggest incentive for me is the price and the quality.  I haven't been impressed with any of the supposed ""higher quality"" tablets because they all cost two or three times as much and haven't got the ability to expand storage capacity as the Fire tablet.  I have an $800 Galaxy phone and it doesn't have half the storage of my Fire.  It also doesn't have the capability to store pictures and apps to the SD card that the Fire has.Maybe I'm old school or don't feel the need to complain about nit picky things.  I love my Fire tablet.",,,
7,"Love the charging platform I just bought this Kindle 8HD Plus.  Not because my other two 8HD's had died, but because from the years of plugging the unplugging in the charger cable, no matter which cable I tried, apparently the charging port in the Kindle no longer could hold the cable (I assume a pin or two had bent/broken).  I learned this is a common problem.  So while I hated to lose two perfectly good Kindles, there was no point if I couldn't charge them.So, I went with the Kindle 8HD plus.  It still has all the good features of the others, plus some extras, but there are a few negatives when you first buy it:Size:  the Plus has the same screen size, but the body of it is just enough shorter and wider than your old HD8 case won't fit.  So, if you like having a case, you have to buy a new one.  At least I was able to find one from their warehouse, so I saved about $10 there, not caring whether the box was perfect.Cost:  Obviously, because you have to buy the charging platform separately, that's an extra cost.  Cha-Ching!Altogether, I ended up paying  $166.96.  Now, that's not bad, were it not for the fact of my two old ones still working perfectly, except for the port.  I'll probably send them back to Amazon and may get $10 for them.  Still I can't imagine life without my Kindle.",,,,

9,"Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, HD display, 32 GB Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, HD display, 32 GB: I bought this Kindle so I could attend Zoom meetings and have holiday visits with family and friends. My two previous Kindle Fires are 2011 and 2012. This year, I acquired my first smart phone and was using Zoom on that, but with increased use, I wanted a larger screen. The Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus feels like a cross between the original Kindle and a smart phone, which means I'm still adjusting to a pretty different arrangement. The good news is that most of my apps came forward to the 8 Plus, and I was familiar with a Kindle.Challenges:  Some of my apps don't behave well on the 8 Plus, but they didn't behave that well originally (difficulty exiting the app) Some behave better or have more options. Finding where things are on the 8 Plus is a big challenge at first. You can move the apps around, so that your commonly used apps can be at the front of the line. (Just be careful to wait until there is a space between the icons, or you get two apps in a ""file."") You can also access EPUB (non-Kindle) books with the SILK browser, which I couldn't do on my older Kindles.The biggest challenge was finding a case that had the front camera at the top. The control buttons are on the right, which bothers some people, so there are cases with the camera on the bottom and the buttons on the left, which doesn't work well for Zoom meetings, and there is one with the camera at the top (DTangLsm), so the buttons are on the right.I will keep exploring the 8 Plus, but the Zoom worked fine for two meetings, one of which had the link in an email, and the other, I went to the site and linked there. And, the price wasn't too bad, cheaper than a laptop.",,,,

2,,"Wow!  Very fast and responsive! I've owned in the past a few Kindle and Fire models -- that last one was the 2016 HD 8 version.  I gotta say this new 2020 version is faster and more responsive than the older ones...  I love that!I know that my following suggestions will be mostly based on the OS, perhaps they can take some of my ideas to heart...I'd like for them to be able to add (alongside the clock) the date also on the top bar.  It now takes 2 steps to see the date on the unit.  Scroll down twice the top to see the date.It seems they removed the visual page (settings) of what is sucking up all the CPU and RAM on the unit.  I hope they can bring that feature back.  It's good to keep an eye on faulty APPs.There seems to be a bug with the default app: Reader or WPS Office, because each time I attempt to exit or leave the application after viewing a .doc , I get a message that I need to send an error report. -- Plus it's also quite difficult to press on the X on the upper right hand corner to exit the app.  Since the tablet's top menu (time, wi-fi, battery icons, and etc.) are in the way.Well, that seems to be it, pretty sure those are more fixes they can do on the OS then the unit itself, so far so good.Oh, and they ought to really work on in improving the camera, c'mon, we ought to get an auto-zoom and also a flash when taking pics at night.  Plus the headphone jack should have more volume output power when using normal headphones.Plus they should put the volume and power buttons far away from each other.... oh the times I've messed up by trying to lower the volume I tend to close the screen (soft power off) by making the error of pressing the power button.  Ugghh!  I guess I gotta get used to the new placement on those.",,,

The OS is outdate by 15 yrs make it fills like the old WebOs  device and even the app store reminds me of WebOS. If apple made this kind of device they would of drop the mobile device line a long time ago. An the adware at a discounted price is still over priced. Never pay full for a fire tablet they all should be under $80. Compared to my vankyo  tablet that I got under $80 couple years ago and had less ram and memory and a printing problem. The vankyo was still a better tablet and I could do 90% more with it then the fire tablet.Would I recommended it yes to a Amazon junky, little kid or some who read ebooks or some who want to watch streaming videos with limit apps.

5,,"Love it I'm in love with my Kindle HD 8 fire tablet, I came from the 7 HD and it is a major improvement, it is much faster due to the RAM and for comics, mangas and media content is an awesome device.",,,
6,"Works well, but confusing button layout I didn't need this, but the trade-in offer was too good. I had a 7"" that I paid $35 for back in the day, and Amazon have me $10+20% off, so it was $26 towards a new one. Since the old 7 was sitting in a box, unused, I decided to try the new 8 plus.It's definitely faster and more responsive. I like the larger size, but the best parts are the USB-C and wireless charging options. Another thing that I noticed, but is never mentioned, is that my HD 10 (7th generation) has 5Ghz Wi-Fi but not all channels, whereas this one does. Since routers are set on default channels and most people don't change them, they get crowded. I always change mine to less crowded channels, but some devices don't receive them like the older tablets (and Roku devices).I was able to easily use some specific tools (you can Google it) to customize this tablet, even though I use Amazon services quite a lot. It's one of the reasons I love Android. I am not an Android expert, so it is really easy for most people.Update after a week: the camera is in a very strange spot. In portrait alignment, it is on the left, as are the speakers. It doesn't seem strange until you put it into a case. I got a folding folio style one on Fleabag, and I was confused as to why it opened to the right (opposite of a book). Well, if it opened to the left like normal cases, the power and volume buttons would be on the bottom in portrait mode. Basically, the buttons are all on the wrong side. It's a very confusing design choice.Update after a month: this thing is a champ after some modifications. You can do your own research on what I mean... I discovered something brilliant about this that I've never seen before, including Apple devices: when this tablet is in landscape mode, it automatically orient's the volume switches so that the button closest to you/surface is always ""volume down."" It's a small design integration, but it's ingenious.",,,,

9,,"You may need to temper your expectations I bought this tablet to replace my Fire 7"" (2019) since after the latest update it became super sluggish. This tablet is quite the upgrade. I bought the 32 GB model because I always use SD cards to bolster the internal storage. The battery life on it is excellent but to be fair I did cut the brightness to 50% so there's that. It's not too easy to see the screen in direct sunlight but eh it is what it is. The 3 GB of RAM makes it super snappy,but it may not beat other tablets or even your cell phone in this regard because it uses a different processor. I also don't mind everything in 720p because I watch a lot of older shows and movies. I have used the Qi functions on this thing exactly once and that was as a test,I prefer plugging it in with the included AC adapter. To be honest for a while I was trying to decide if I wanted this or the standard 8 and the Qi had no bearing on my decision. But yeah the gray does look gaudy without a case on it so of course I bought one and it's pretty in pink. I mainly use headphones with this because while the stereo speakers aren't bad sounding I do end up having to blow up the volume because the case I bought prevents reverb a bit. The cameras are OK: I typically don't take pictures with any of my tablets (I also have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 2019). But for video calls the front camera is fine,or at least that's my dad's opinion since he borrows it for said video calls *laughs*. Overall for the money this is a great device,I love it even with it's minor nitpicks but do yourself a favor and avoid trying to side load Google Play on these Amazon tablets: so not worth the aggravation.",,,

1,,"Fire HD 8 Plus offers great technical specs at an affordable price I purchased this as a long overdue replacement for my 4th generation Fire HD 6. I primarily use my Fire tablets as Kindle devices because I'm a fan of the text-to-speech functionality. (Did you know you can also ask your Alexa Echo devices to read your Kindle books to you?) Aside from the improved specs in the new 2020 10th Generation version, I was especially looking forward to being able to Alexa in Show mode without having to be tethered to an outlet - this functionality alone is well worth the product price IMO. The Fire HD 8 tablet is a great choice for people who want to read or listen to Kindle books, watch streaming video content (Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, YouTube, etc.) or casually browse the internet. Both of my Fire tablets have had the 'Special Offers'; they don't bother me at all.Favorite Features:- Amazing Battery Life!!- Alexa 'Show Mode' - like having a wireless Echo Show!- Text-to-Speech functionality for Kindle- Expandable Memory up to 1TB- Dolby Speakers = decent sound quality- Has a 3.5mm Audio Jack- 3GB RAM & Wireless Charging (Plus model)- Angreat 10W Wireless Charging Dock (sold separately) is well-designedA few minor gripes:- I wish the included charging cable were longer, but I ordered a wireless charging dock- It would be great if the 'Plus' model came in more colors- Camera quality could be improved- Fingerprint Magnet- Google Play Store not included by default",,,
2,,,,"Runs Super Slow Ok, last time I wrote a review for this product (the first one I received), Amazon blocked the review from being posted. Even an Amazon employee who looked at the review said that they couldn't understand why the review was not approved. I think it's safe to assume that considering this is an Amazon product, they don't exactly take too kindly to negative reviews of their own products. Of course, they have to let a few of them through to make it look like they're not actually censoring people. If this review is also rejected, then I will go to every product review site that I know of and make sure to spread the word about how terrible this product is.Ok, so around 4 weeks ago, I had grown tired of many of the apps on my Kindle Fire HDX no longer working because it was about 5 or 6 years old and the apps could no longer update. Stuff like the internet browser, I had no problem with, but I was tired of the ever increasing number of apps that no longer ran. I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to a Fire HD 8 Plus. Boy, what a mistake that turned out to be.This tablet is slooooow. I mean, it takes a good 20-30 seconds for a page to load when doing a Google search. Spotify runs so slow that sometimes I can't even get the page to fully load to play the songs. You Tube usually takes at least 30 seconds to load, sometimes a minute and a half to two minutes. That's just to actually get the video to even be able to start! Then you usually have to pause the video for another minute to be able to load enough of it so that it won't keep starting and stopping. I called for support to see what could be causing the issues. The representative I talked to had me make sure the latest updates were installed: updated it, and no change. Then, I did a factory reset. Again, just as slow as before.Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Maybe you just got a lemon."" Yeah, that's what I thought too. After doing all of the troubleshooting steps, I got a replacement. At first, it seemed promising, as the new one seemed to work quickly on internet searches right away, as well as You Tube. I only took a quick couple of minutes to check things out because I had to go somewhere, but I went to bed that night thinking everything was straightened out.No such luck. Took more time to check it out again the next day and everything is running super slow. I end up getting called by an Amazon representative because I filled out a product survey that let them know that I was not very impressed.Again, I go through the troubleshooting steps: checking updates, turning the device off and on, and doing a factory reset. All failed to make a difference. We test my internet speed and there's no problems there. In a last-ditch effort, they try to blame my WiFi connection. So I ask ""If my WiFi was the issue, then how come a couple of weeks ago I was using a Fire HDX that was 5 or 6 years old that was running perfectly fine with internet? I have no extra devices on my WiFi since then, so why is this new tablet running at a snail's pace when a 5 or 6 year old one was running perfectly fine a couple of weeks ago?""""I...I don't...I don't have an answer to that,"" the representative stammered.Of course you don't, because it doesn't make sense! The only thing that makes sense is that this product is inferior. My guess is that Amazon is using out of date software in these tablets. It's a real shame, because the Fire HDX was basically the same price when I bought it brand new around 5-6 years ago and was a great product. Now, I feel like I'm using a computer with a floppy disk drive in 2020. Amazon has definitely cheapened their Fire tablets, and it's very unfortunate, because I used to highly recommend them to others. Obviously, that will no longer be the case. I think Amazon felt like they could cut corners and give their customers an inferior product and still get away with it.",
3,,"Great price when on sale! I bought this tablet and Amazon case during the Prime Days.  The price is great and the screen quality and battery life is good.  This is a replacement for my Google Nexus2 tablet,  I like the magnetic connection to keep the cover secure and turn the screen off.  This is similar to the iPad cover.The only complain about this tablet is that I can not hold it in one hand like I had with Nexus2.  The Amazon cover doesn't help much on this part.  I understand that this is the difference between 8"" and 7"" tablets.  But if the cover have a ring like those on the cell phone cases, it would be perfect!",,,
4,"8 Plus is Great Device This is my 4th Fire Tablet.  I have had two 7"" and one 10"" device before this 8"".  I really like it.  I probably still like the 7"" version best because I primarily use it for reading in bed and it is lighter to hold.  However, my battery was no longer dependable(it was getting pretty old!)  and the 8"" is the most recently updated version so I went with it.  The 10"" Tablet is primarily used by my husband while sitting in his recliner.  We both like it.I bought the 8 Plus version, no ads.  The no ads feature is not worth the $15....but I had never done that before and decided to try it.  This little tablet is really good so far. The picture is great as far as I am concerned, the sound quality far exceeds previous versions, and it is super fast.  Obviously since this is my 4th Fire, I am a big fan.  It does everything I need it to do.  I have a laptop PC for those occasions when anything else is needed - but that doesn't happen very often. I can put this in my pocketbook and have it handy for game playing or reading a book in any ""waiting"" situation.  I read with this device, use it for email, and surf the web a bit but am not constantly on any device.  For me it is perfect.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  I have not tried it in ""Show Mode"" since that is not really a feature that made me want the device.The only reason for the less than 5 star rating is the lack of an improved camera and the change in the camera placement.  Very, very awkward position and therefore making it hard to use if you have a case/cover for the tablet.  I really don't understand why the design team felt that change is an improvement.Overall, I highly recommend this 8 Plus Fire Tablet.",,,,
5,"Fire HD8 Plus - Good and Bad Bought this specifically to serve as the heart of a ""Man Cave"" coffee table digital music system using Edifier BT1700 powered speakers. It is working surprisingly well, but there are a few good and bad points:The Good-It was much cheaper than a iPadUsing it with the wireless charging dock keeps the tablet in position for use on the table and it charges anytime the system is turned on. The rate of charge is faster than the battery drain while playing music.Battery life is very good.It works well with Amazon Prime Music HD- no issues with speed or audio.The Bluetooth 5.0 actually gives the best wireless audio quality I have ever experienced. Connected wirelessly to Edifier BT1700's, it sounds noticeably  better than the wired connection.The Bad:The volume level through the tablet's speakers is ridiculously low. There are volume booster apps, but all Ive tried distort the sound.Heres the BIG one- the upgraded USB-C port is worthless to me as USB audio is not supported. I would like to incorporate an external DAC to make use of Prime Music HD's capability, but that is impossible due to this major shortcoming. Because of this, the audio from tracks on Prime Music HD is limited to 24bit- 48kHtz. Ive confirmed the shortcoming with Amazon Support, and I doubt if this issue can or will be corrected. With the wireless charging dock, the USB-C port sits unused when it would be a great feature if it was enabled for audio use.Ive noticed that occasional ""jittering"" of the music occurs (short episodes of cutting in and out while music is playing). Rebooting the tablet seems to correct the issue. This has only been necessary once or twice since Ive had it.Overall, it is a pretty good basic tablet that could easily be made much better if Amazon would just make a few adjustments. I have my doubts that they will.The tablet will serve its intended purpose for now, but I will likely replace it with a ""standard"" Android tablet (with useable USB audio) sometime down the road.",,,,

But at times, the 10 in was a bit heavy to lug around.So, when the price was dropped to $79 for the HD 8+ I could not pass it up. I turned in a older 10 inch Fire (5th gen) to sweeten the deal (and get 20% off) and then Amazon took off $30 as well and my $109 HD 8+ was reduced to about $35 or so (pre-tax).  Heck, even if I did not love it, it was well worth it.  I still have my Gen 7 ten inch fire and my Oasis.But I do love this HD 8 +.  Watched RED on it (for the 100th time), Train to Busan, Night Crew, and Episode 4 of Season 1 of Hanna,  and they all looked and sounded great.  I have played a few games on it and I am currently reading some books on it.In the same order as my 8 HD +  I also picked up a Poetic Turtle case that helps amplify the sound.  Works very well.  All in all, I love this 8 inch HD.  Ordered a 256 GB Micro SD card (for about $22) to extend the storage for movies and books.  I read comics on it as well and have had no problems.With the faster speed/new OS, and the extra RAM, I have been using this 8 in Fire also exclusively the  past week.  It is just so darn versatile and handy.  Perfect for what I want: to watch videos, play games, and read graphic novels and e-books.  For only $35, what a deal!  Had it for a week now, and used it every day.  No problems and no hassles.",,,
7,"Tablet is fine, but do not count on backups I bought this to replace a 7th generation Kindle Fire 8. Everything looks great except the restore from backup option keeps failing and all customer service can suggest to me is try signing into another wifi signal. If you're just starting out with a Kindle this is a great device. If you don't want to manually recreate a previous Kindle, you might want to wait until they work this bug out.",,,,
8,"Great value but no chance for competitive virus/ malware protection Except for its rather tinny audio and proprietary operating system, this tablet is a surprising bargain, with ample memory for an reasonable book and music library. But here's the catch:Because Amazon chose to employ their proprietary operating system, the only virus or malware protection programs Amazon provides are second-tier programs from it's app store, most with unknown trademarks. Some, which Amazon post as ""free"" cost $49 on average after a 30-day trial. As purchase stats show, few users buy them. SO, if you buy one of these tablets, know that your data is vulnerable in a far different way than it is on any other conventional platform. Use for Kindle, Audible or Amazon music only.Such proprietary thinking is the greatest flaw of an otherwise functional tablet with a crisp, bright screen, except in brightest surroundings. Battery life is competitive. Touch screen is decent but unremarkable. Audio output sounds fine on phones or buds, but loudspeaker is rather tinny. Avoid using for any personal, business or critical use, from phone calls to bank transactions.Weight is uncommonly heavy for a tablet with these dimensions.If you do buy one, consider buying with Amazon's wireless charger for the unit. It works well if you use Amazon's recommended cases. If you use cases from other marketers you may experience problems with fit and connectivity.I look forward to the day when the tablet group at Amazon employs a conventional Android, or comparable standard format. But I feat that won't happen in my lifetime.",,,,
9,Great to handle The fire tablet is very easy to handle. The weight is a lot less than my older 10” models that I had without sacrificing my viewing. The reading applications are great as always. My only issues are the slowness of the Silk browser and the sound quality (always seems too low to me on all the models I had so far.).,,,,
0,"My Third Fire Tablet is my favorite. The Fire 8 HD Plus is the newest of three Fire Tablets I have purchased and used. It is also the fastest, easiest to use, and has the longest battery life of the three. I have been using this 8 HD Plus for six weeks now. My original 7"" Fire HD tablet has served me well for more than three years, and is fully functional now. It does have a cracked screen, which has not impaired its use. Battery life had declined over three years of heavy use, which meant I had to  plug it in to charge sooner and more often. I ran out of power on a few occasions during long waits related to medical care. I decided to buy a new tablet when the 8"" Fire HD was specially priced earlier this year. I bought the 16 gig version and added a 64 gig micro sd card. Setup was seamless. I liked the new tablet and used it regularly for two months. My wife started using the older tablet and I noticed she became an avid tablet user. The new 8"" tablet worked well, had great graphics, and great battery  life. It was not any faster than my previous tablet, though. When Amazon had a special offer on the 8"" HD Plus I read the specs and reviews, noting in particular that the Plus has a quad core processor. I bought one, added a 64 gig micro sd card, and gave my 8"" HD model to my wife. The Quad core processor in the Plus is a definite improvement with faster performance and less lag time. Battery life is great, charging time is short, and the tablet does everything I want it to do. This is a ""best bang for the buck"" buy in a tablet. Yes, it is a low end tablet, but it supplies everything I need in one at a very reasonable price. I am pleased with the Plus, recommend it's faster processor over the HD model, and sincerely recommend it.",,,,
1,,,"A decent tablet for streaming, but a little bit disappointed I picked up this tablet as it was on sale and wanted to replace my outdated iPad Mini, which is losing support on many platforms and isn't able to get the latest OS updates. Somehow, the Fire HD 8 feels like a step down from the iPad Mini, even though it's almost 8 years later.Pros:Works well with streaming on almost all major services. Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+, HBOMax, etc. all work fairly well.Sound and picture quality are decent, the brightness is pretty good as well.Has USB-C charging but also a 3.5 mm audio jack.Battery life is quite good.It has integration with Alexa, and can act as an Echo Show.Cons:This is a 2020 model tablet, but seems to be running on what looks like a 2010 Android OS. Not a very great UI by today's standards. And despite clearly running a version of Android, it's excluded many of the great Google Android Apps, notably YouTube and Google Play.The Amazon app store is horrible in comparison to the Google Play store, which makes it seem like this tablet is much less capable than any other Android tablets. Good quality third party apps seem convolutedly hard to find, and the app store tends to feature lots of overpriced shovel-ware apps that are clearly knock offs of other properties.The touch screen doesn't feel that great, especially compared to any Apple or Samsung device. Again, it feels like an older, cheap Android screen. But this isn't really an issue if it's mainly used for streaming or reading.One annoying thing I've noticed is that in any video app, clicking pause, play, or rewind/fast forward causes the speakers to make a loud, static like pop.There's also the inclusion of Ads on the lock screen, but they're unobtrusive and can be opted out of by paying a fee.TLDR: It's a good Kindle/Netflix device, but it feels outdated and lacks the features of similar tablets on the market.",,
2,"Very fast, great for books and videos Great tablet, I had a small Fire 6 through high school and college. It was fine for reading and basic web searches. I mostly rented textbooks on it for school. This Fire 8 Plus is so much faster, clearer, and easier to hold. By 2022 the Fire 6 was not much bigger than a smartphone, this tablet is a great size and isn't too heavy. Books, videos, and games load easily and are mostly clear. It loses points only because Amazon limits its capability. You cannot delete preloaded apps like Goodreads and cannot add apps like Youtube (you can get around this pretty easily though). The Plus also only comes in grey which is okay but a little disappointing. I love the 64 GB option as my last tablet only held 8GB. I really like my tablet and bought another one for my mom to upgrade her 16GB Fire 8.",,,,
3,"Decent small tablet Bought this during prime day and for the price, it’s hard to beat the value of what you get.  Decent screen, nice colors and lots of little touches like wireless charging, and SD slot and it comes in different colors. An iPad it’s not but then again, your not paying iPad money for it.",,,,
4,"Using it as a Kindle reader. $55 price was a steal! I got this as an alternative to the Kindle e-readers as I like to listen to audiobooks and read at the same time and the Kindle cannot do that, from my understanding. This was also much cheaper. For reading, this is more than enough. I was worried the lower PPI on this compared to the Kindle Paperwhite would be noticeable but it’s not an issue at all. In the included photos, I made the font as small as I could and it’s complete readable and not pixelated to me. I included a photo so you could see the letters up close.One thing I noticed immediately after opening is the screen DOES NOT have palm rejection. If your finger is ever so slightly on the screen while holding it, you won’t be able to scroll at all. The screen also needs a coating on it for fingerprints. Gets super dirty really fast. I think it should also have a light sensor on the side so when you hold it in portrait, it’s able to auto adjust properly. I tend to cover it and the screen gets too dim. Hopefully we see those in future updates.For reading, this tablet is great! I can’t speak on entertainment purposes though. No lag issues here with my usage!",,,,

7,,,"Device Dashboard Icon is TERRIBLE! I can revise my review stars if this 'useful' feature is ever removed from my tablet.You WILL  run into the same problem I'm having, especially if you're a left handed reader; your left thumb will NEARLY always tap that button and suddenly your screen changes to the 'device dashboard' option.I suspect this was put on the LEFT thumb print since MOST users are righties.But it's super annoying. I just bought this tablet replace my much older model of 5 years since that old guy was only charging sporadically.I looked online and found 1 suggestion to apply a 3rd party app to 'reduce' the size of it. seriously? And ONE guy suggested using Gorilla Tape to cover that part of the screen. To minimize me accidentally activating the icon. Guess what? I did that with 3 layers of duct tape. It works. I guess duct tape can even PATCH this problem.See my Pic. Nice? Yep. Perfect and cheap way to PATCH that problem. I guess I'll just wait until a future update when Amazon Fire team removes that icon or I don't know, LETS ME MOVE AROUND to a less annoying spot or heck a 'disable/hide' function.3 of 5 stars cuz I had to REALLY use duct tape. Seriously?",,
8,,"I'm very impressed with the Kindle Fire 8HD Plus I've had 3 different kindle readers over the years and enjoyed reading on each of them but I find that scrolling through my library and collections is always a chore, even with the Oasis.  On my iPad and iPhone the Kindle app makes scrolling a breeze.  So I decided to get a Kindle Fire to use as a reader.  I got the 8 because I knew I would want to use it for other things as well as reading and the 7 seemed too small while the 10 seemed too large and bulky to be held in one hand.  The 8 is just right for my hand but it would be too large for one-handed reading for my wife and many other people.  I love the screen, I find reading on it to be a joy, and the battery life is very good (under the conditions I use the device).  This is my first foray into the Android universe, having been a firm user of iOS tablets and smartphones for many years, and I must say I am very impressed with how well things work.  It has definitely been an eye-opener for me and I recommend a Fire tablet to people who enjoy reading on a Kindle but find the file system too unwieldy.  And just as I thought I have found a lot of very useful apps (I'm a professional musician and have found a music reading program similar to what I use on my iPad) and a lot of fun entertainment.  One great feature of the Fire tablets is that they have micro-SD slots so that the user can expand the memory without great added expense.  The Fire 8 HD Plus will take up to a 1TB micro-SD card, but I just couldn't quite afford that so I got a 512GB card and still have a lot of room left after copying over all my videos and mp3 files and PDFs of music.It's a great device!",,,
9,,,Daily Kindle User I am a daily kindle user. I have had regular kindles and kindle fires. This most recent kindle fire chaps my patience. I will be reading and sit it down and a couple of minutes later pick it up and it won’t turn on. In order for it to turn back on I have to plug it in for a couple of minutes. I have done resets and other things to fix it with no luck. It is so annoying. The rest of the kindle fire is fantastic and I have no complaints.,,
0,"It's a Kindle.  Yay.  ;) I owned the Fire (Generation 5) before this and was looking to upgrade for a while.  I can't say there's a lot of difference.  This one, obviously, is larger and has more memory, which is nice considering I filled the memory of my old kindle with my library.  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.  Battery life is good.  Charging time is acceptable.Since I almost exclusively use this for reading many of the features are overlooked.  I'm sure they work as prescribed in most cases, but rarely use them.  So take that as you will.Amazon still has a terrible--terrible might not be a strong enough word--approach to managing and sorting the library.  Hopefully, they'll wake up and improve this aspect a great deal, but I'm not holding my breath.  The only other thing I'm not pleased with is the location of the power button.  It was on the corner of my old kindle, but it's in the center, right next to the volume buttons on this one.  I much prefer the corner location.  Minor details, all said.  Transferring files to this is sad.  If I wanted the stupidity of Apple, then I would have purchased an Apple product.  Choices are to download Amazon's app to transfer between my computer and the kindle or use an app like dropbox.  Both are poor and completely unnecessary choices.  The systems is android based so there is zero reason to not be able to plug it into the computer and transfer files directly.  With my old kindle this was possible but didn't work well.  Now it seems that it isn't even possible.  Sure it can be hooked up to the computer but the computer immediately disconnects it from access.  These three things are why I didn't give it five stars.",,,,
1,,Hubby is really enjoying this! I bought this as a gift for my husband. He uses it mainly to read books but also to browse the internet when we go on short trips and he doesn't want to take his laptop. We are not very tech savvy but were able to set this up pretty easily.,,,
2,,"QI Technology FIRE 8 HD PLUS-a breakthrough! This is my third Fire- the first two Fire 10 became unusable because the insertion point for charging became useless after owning them LESS than 18 months each. THATS TWO Fire tablets . while i loved the tablet itself i had a really hard time convincing myself to buy another if it’s manufactured so cheaply. So I looked at Ipads and nearly bit the bullet even though none had the QI technology...until i discovered that Amazon just made this Fire 8 HD plus tablet with QI CHARGING. I thought long and hard because I got so disgusted with my previous fire shortcomings that I was done with Amazon. How can they make a great product but screw up on the super soft metal at the insertion point?? it was SO frustrating to lose 2 tablets within 18 months of purchase because it wouldn’t hold the cord.  ( yes yes yes...i tried new cords, outlets, and adapters. The cord had to be in a very precise position to take the charge- ridiculous amt of effort for a fairly new tablet.)So now that I don’t have to mess with poor design or quality, i bought this FIRE 8 HD PLUS tab and the charging station together and am very happy with this wireless charging capabilities- I sure hope it lasts more that 18 months this time around.The tablet itself is great but i do think the screen brightness could be improved- it seems a bit dark to me even at it highest brightest setting. And the volume is a little to LOW- even at its highest setting.I would recommend this unique tablet with QI charging capability to anyone.I left a review for the QI charger as well- charges fast as well as charges my iphone so I am super thrilled with this setup!I just hope that the tablet lasts longer than 18 months because this is IT. Three strikes and Amazon tablets are OUT and i go to another brand. Fingers crossed.",,,

5,,"Awesome Tablet for half the price of the iPad. This is the first time I ever thought of purchasing the Amazon Fire 8 HD Plus. Although it doesn't have the features that a person like me is comfortable with when it comes to the iPad, it is still a very good alternative. The installed apps can be a nuisance, if you just drop them into a folder, then you have eliminated with almost no muss the apps that are bothersome.The battery life is out of sight, going for upwards of 6-8 hours of standby charge, and about 2 hours for viewing time. Amazon has a very strong video assortment and their book selections are well- priced. If you enjoy reading as much as I do, then the screen is fine for the purpose. There could be some complications with the usage of Zoom, as the camera is definitely not up to par with the iPad.The ads on the Lock Screen are not even a factor to consider if you want to save money. But if it bothers you, then please pay the full price. I am quite happy with this tablet and basically use it for reading, keeping my iPad free for other projects.Congratulations to anyone who purchases the 2020 version of the Fire 8HD Plus.",,,
6,"Very good at the very least. I won't go over a long list of specifics, there are already a gazillion reviews that nicely do this. My personal issues, are these: the screen is very nice, and having a little more RAM makes it work pretty quickly. Nice availability of screen savers and cases, makes it nice, I hate getting a good deal on a newer device, and having to shell out a bunch for those two necessities. It is not very loud, but the sound is very good. I can add an app to increase the volume, which I have to older Kindles. None compare to the HDX Kindles, EVER, but those were extremely expensive, even used. Also, when I want to see all the reviews of an item, and I always use desktop view, it will not go to all of the reviews. I like to search reviews for specific things, and can't do this. I called tech service, and it will not work, hopefully it will be fixed. I don't like using the mobile version, it is a little too big a screen for that, slightly small for desktop, but fine. I use a real desktop or my 10"" Kindle when I need more real estate.I know going in, that this tablet is a selling machine, and I know how to resist buying stuff. So much better than an android tablet that requires endless work to keep your info private, at least a little bit. I have no problem with Amazon wanting to track my shopping, big deal. I wait till Amazon devices are on specials, and have a big one and smaller one, this one, going all the time. It is necessary to get an updated Kindle occasionally to get newer apps. The old ones randomly die on you. SO mad when that happens. But, that's life.",,,,
7,,,"Won't connect to home network I've had other Amazon Fire devices and loved them. I was very excited to upgrade to this latest model. However I've been unable to get it to connect to my home network. I have reset the modem, reset the tablet, checked to make sure WI-FI password was correct, checked to see if other devices were connecting to the network (they were, signal was excellent), and turned on/off airplane mode, nothing worked. Thinking the tablet was defective, I called Amazon for assistance. They took me through the same steps I'd already performed on my own, the device still wouldn't connect. A new tablet was sent to me and arrived the next day. When I attempted to set it up I had the same problem.After attempting to connect for a long time the device says ""disabled"" by my home network. We performed one other test: connecting the tablet to a phone that was connected to the network, and connecting the tablet to a computer that was connected to the network. If the Fire connects to another device being used as a hotspot it connects fine. I updated the tablet while connected in this way to make sure it was up to date and tried to connect directly to the network again. No change, it still wouldn't connect and said ""disabled"" by my network. I've spent two days trying to research this issue. I've discovered I'm not alone in this problem, but no solutions have been offered. At this point if Amazon is unable to provide a solution I guess I will have to return the tablet. I'm very disappointed. My advice to other perspective buyers would be to wait and see if this issue is resolved before purchasing.Update: I continued to research and troubleshoot for a few days I performed every test I could find* but the problem persisted. I contacted Amazon through chat, let them know all the tests I'd conducted and asked if they had any further guidance. The tech that assisted me told me I'd done what they'd have recommended, and from this point suggested that I contact my ISP with a list of questions about my modem, then contact Amazon again for further assistance if needed. When we contacted our ISP they discovered that our modem, an older model, was not running at optimum capacity. (All of our other devices were connecting, even other Fire Tablets, it was just the New Fire tablet that wasn't) We were given another modem and now the tablet is connecting to Wi-Fi. I don't know if others with connection problems might be facing the same issue, but it's worth checking if you experience trouble connecting to your home network.The tablet is now up and seems to be working fine, except for the fact that I've been unable to get my AOL email to work on it. All other accounts work fine but I keep getting the message that the password is invalid, though it is correct. I believe this is an issue on AOL's end though, not Amazon.",,
8,,"A worthy successor to the HDX It is well known that the HDX was the holy grail of Fire tablets. I have been a Fire user since gen 1 (which I recently traded in for the new HD 8 Plus), but the HDX was the epitome of an inexpensive, quality Android tablet. It was speedy, reliable and had a great screen. I used mine so much that the battery died and I replaced it just so I could keep using it, even after Amazon stopped updating apps for it. When I decided to upgrade to the HD 8 (8th gen), I was so disappointed. The HD 8 is trash. It is an embarrassment. It doesn't even run Amazon products like Alexa or Music properly, and the browser runs so slow to be almost unusable.  When I stumbled on the new HD 8 plus, I decided to replace the HD 8. Finally, a worthy successor to the HDX! As you can see from the image I uploaded, it finally nudges out the 7-year-old HDX in speed, but better yet, Amazon supports all the apps and it runs great.

1,,"To my surprise, it's a worthwhile purchase I have no hesitation in recommending this version of the Amazon Fire Tablets. Over the years I have purchased and either accidently destroyed or given away the original Kindle Fire, a Kindle, the 2018 Fire 8 (it didn't like getting dropped on concrete) and the 2018 Fire 7 (I loved the size, but hated the functionality of the tablet). I also have a very old 7"" Samsung that still runs fine even if the battery is limping and a 2020 8"" tablet from Lenovo.I love the Lenovo - so why did I succumb to another 8"" tablet from Amazon? It was on sale over Christmas and it claimed to have a really good battery. To my surprise, I really like it. It is noticeably more stable and  faster, and the battery is good - it certainly lasts longer than the 2018 version. I now use the Amazon Fire tablet (after making it Google Play compatible) on a daily basis while the Lenovo sits around waiting for its battery to slowly drain.I suppose I should try find something to complain about, but for my purposes (listening to books, reading the news, browsing the web, playing the occasional video) it works great. Ok - like any tablet there are news sites and video where the tablet sputters. But I'm not going to ding the tablet for developers who don't make their sites or apps mobile friendly.",,,
2,,"Best version of a great tablet This is my 4th Fire tablet, each time upgrading to a newer version or passing the old one to family.

3,"Really goid but doesn’t sync sound with echo speakers!!?? If you’re coming from an iPad from the last 6 years you’re going to be disappointed with the screen quality but if you can't justify the price of an iPad this is really good alternative. I’ve noticed the wifi signal ca be pretty weak at times too therefore can make watching a movie look worse/pixelated. When WiFi is working okay the picture of movies is pretty good.  Fire OS is really archaic looking at this point. It seems like Amazon is skipping a generation of android inbetween fire versions so the next version of fire os 8 will likely be based on android 11. You would think Amazon being as huge of a company as it is would have a sleeker UI design team but its simple to navigate. The overlay of Amazons services and advertising is way too much for the senses at times and looks like it’s 10 year old software, feels like it too.  Even though I have the HD 8 plus it’s still sluggish. I do like the wireless charging and the dock made for it. Show mode is a nice feature so it makes more sense to get the tablet/dock set up than an echo show. It’s a pretty big bummer you can’t pair any amazon fire tablet to your echo speaker to make them all sync sound together. Part of what you expect of Alexa is the seamless integration. The tablet ignores the Alexa command or give versa if an echo speaker is in the room. Overall you get what you pay for, a cheap tablet that is not at all the worst. The 7” is far too small and the 8” is borderline too small if you’re doing a lot of media consumption get the 10”. All and all it’s good for what it is and movies look good when WiFi is fine.",,,,
4,,,,,"(NOT) Adequate for my needs I have been using an iPad for 9 years and an Apple user for 11 years. I am very used to the IOS operating system. I also have a Nook (only the reader). I have been doing a lot of biking and next year I am planning on doing overnight/multiple night biking trips. I wanted a tablet that was inexpensive since it would be in my bike bag getting jostled around on trips. The sole purpose was to having a small tablet I could read books, watch Netflix at night, and be able to keep a journal of my adventure. All of these things my iPad does but with a huge cost difference (iPad mini $399 vs Kindle $100). Not that I want any tablet to break, but considering the above scenario, $100 loss is easier to take in than a $400 loss. I bought the Kindle 8 Plus on Prime Day so I have not had it very long.CONS:  With that all said, overall I am not overly impressed. Understandably Amazon wants you to use their online book selection, however I am sure I am not the first person to want my Nook books to be able to be read on the Kindle. Since I do not have much experience with any other operating system other than IOS, I am having a lot of difficulties downloading the hack to get the Google Play Store so I can put the Nook app on the Kindle. From what I have been reading this can be done, but for me it is not coming easily. I also was hoping some of the games I play would be available on the Kindle, but that also is not the case (such as Disney Emoji Blitz). If you want Candy Crush, that I can get but I lost interest in that game about 5 or 6 years ago. I have not tried using any kind of journaling type apps yet to be able to record my adventures. As a primarily user of Apple products, I don't find the Kindle very user friendly in general. The ads are highly annoying when you are searching the browser.PROS: It is small and portable which is what I wanted. It was only $104 on Prime Day and I used my Amazon points for the purchase Total Cost using points $0.  If I can't ever get the Nook app, I can borrow books from the library for my reading material on journeys.  It will suffice for my needs.Bottom line: For my needs and the $0 cost it will work (hopefully). However, I think the iPad is much more superior tablet. I think Amazon could have a system more more similar to other tablets without it being completely Amazon based; allow any apps to be downloaded. Just because a person has a Nook app doesn't mean they also wouldn't buy books from Amazon store also. If one of my college students came to me for advice on a tablet device to use for school, Kindle would not be the go to tablet I would suggest.UPDATE:  After careful consideration of 5 days of having this device, I decided to return it! Even though it cost me nothing with my points, ultimately I decided it was not worth the hassle of the steps I needed to take in order to put Apps on that I wanted to use. I choose this because it was small and  inexpensive and I wanted a reader, device to journal, and watch Netflix when I take over night biking trips. A device small enough to fit in my bike bag. I decided that I could easily get a different tablet for those things that do not require a ""side step"" to getting the apps I need and/or want (such as Google).  I am now looking at an inexpensive Lenova or Samsung tablet which won't be limited to Amazon supported apps and run around the same cost as the Kindle."

In the middle of streaming a video, which is why I purchased it, It kept going black for no apparent reason.  What I did to try to fix the problem:  I tried restarting it.  I tried powering it down and powering it back up.  I tried charging it to 100%.  Nothing stopped the screen from going dark and having to restart.  And it seemed to increase in frequency.  So I contacted Amazon for a new one and I was transferred to tech support.  I didn't need tech support.  I know a broken problematic device when I see one.  So another one was approved to be sent to me.  I have received a 3rd replacement by now. (The second one had questionable packaging)  Customer service seems to be great so far.  I will see if this one is reliable enough to send to a disabled person who cannot restart a device when it tends to just go out randomly and repeatedly.  But if it can just stay on and continue to play, it will be all good because the video quality it very nice, and the display size is perfect for the need.  I really want this to work out.  I really need this to work out. Fingers crossed!!",,
9,"Is change good without instructions? There are definitely a lot of changes to the new Fire HD 8 Plus. I am all for change as much as the next person but what good are the changes if you cannot find what you are looking for?To start, the Home page has only three tabs now, ‘For You, Home, and Library.  The ‘For You’ tab is about the same, a few changes but not bad, the ‘Home’ tab is also the same.  The ‘Library’ tab changed a lot. There is now a small list of your books on this page, if you tap the ‘Show More’ you can get a bigger list of your books. As of yet, I cannot find my ‘Collections’ page (I like to sort my books by Fiction, SciFi, Thrillers, etc.). There is also an ‘Apps’ and ‘Games’ space on the Library tab.Once you’ve opened a book, things have changed there also.  The list I’ve found so far that is hard to find:Your bookmarks - once you’ve bookmarked a page it hard to find it.Your book content - at one time you could swipe the page from the left and get a menu screen (About this book, Go to, title page, etc.) I do not see that anymore.Highlighting a section – This is the sameDictionary – This is the same.They need to bring the Kindle Fire HDX back!!!Adding to my review:  It does not give you a low battery warning before 'shutting down'.I am very disappointed with this Fire HD.",,,,
0,"Okay The touch screen seems a bit slow, like a noticable drag. Also, sometimes it seems like it doesn't register my touch as quickly as I think it could. I don't like the ads on the home screen, its annoying. It's a good deal for the money though.",,,,
1,,"In Love I love this tablet it does everything that the Apple Ipads does and the only difference  is the table is cheaper and if you need more memory you will have to buy a sd card for the tablet.

The 10 inch Amazon Fire Tablet is good for people who needs that bigger screen..The Amazon Fire Tablet 8 inch HD is the size of a Ipad Mini...

9,"Battery not charging?  Need to reboot frequently? I've had several Fires.  With the exception of the 10"" (which lasted only a year and a half) and this new one, I've enjoyed using them all.  I'm just not sure about this one.  Twice when I've plugged it in to charge, it hasn't charged.  Settings says, ""plugged in, not charging.""  Well, it's down to 13%-- why not charge?  So I've rebooted and that has ""solved"" the problem.Also, I have a jigsaw puzzle app I've used since 2014.  I've updated it as updates have become available.  Maybe this has nothing to do with this Fire, but, in the short time I've had it, the app has crashed, failed to open, etc., quite a few times.  Again, I reboot.The Kindle app is great and I use it daily.  I like the new button where all of the utilities live.I failed to buy the warranty with my big, fancy 10-inch Fire.

This generation 10 is not as long as my last kindle fire but a little wider its great and very portable to carry around i put mine it in my walker bag and it fits great it is the perfect size and weight. I bought the plum amazon fire case that is made for this fire and it is much nicer than the previous generation case it stands up better on smooth surface the old one slid and sit at an angle on the counter which was annoying but this one is great. I love surfing the web and can find anything just like on those expensive tablets, and i can also use it to pay bills like any other tablet, of course I am use to the fire tablets and know what to expect. I read a lot of books and love the free books I can borrow all the time and reading digital is great I dont have books laying around that i have already read. I like watching videos on here also it has a great picture and sound is not bad either, I dont have any problems with battery life and I like the usb-c charging plug and i can charge it on the charging pad i charge my iphone on and it charges just fine which is convenient. I like that alexa is active when i am using it but i changed the name to amazon so it doesnt interfere with my other echos in the house. This little tablet has a lot to offer and i havent tried everything yet but i love it and its faster than my last fire 8 which was a generation 6 i think anyway i love it for everday use.",,,
4,"MY review of Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, HD display, 64 GB, latest model (2020 release) The Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, HD display, 64 GB, latest model (2020 release) is a huge improvement over the 7"" HD, version 3 I previously owned.  The quad processor and 2GB of RAM make it a smooth, fast tablet for general web browsing, shopping, etc.  The limitations are that Amazon doesn't support Google play apps. Even though it is an Android-based system it is Amazon proprietary and that limits apps that it will run, which I found disappointing as there are some apps I would love to sync with my phone or computer. But, with the 64GB of memory and the purposes I use it for it should prove to be a useful tablet -- with the limitations all tablets have.",,,,

6,It works fine It is wider and shorter than the old version so it is difficult to hold. Has much more memory,,,,
7,,"Night and day compared to my previous Kindle Fire. This is my third Fire tablet. I picked up a Gen 1 at launch, then a Gen 2 which has been in service till now. The original sadly lost it's life in a tragic drop accident. It's in debate as to who actually caused this to happen, and the family remains divided. I bought the new Fire HD 8 Plus version to replace my existing unit for a few reasons. The loss of battery life, only 16GB of storage, and a noticeable lag in performance. I don't think the device actually got slower, I think I just grew accustomed to the increased performance of other devices around it. The jump from 1.3 Ghz (I believe) to 2 Ghz, 16GB to 32GB in storage and the additional microSD card slot (which I know were available before now but not on mine), and going from a 7"" to 8"" screen, puts this device in a whole different class to the Kindle Fire HD 7. It might not be quite on par with those tablets at the top of the heap, but for the price and my use case it can't be beat.If there was one thing I'd feel inclined to mention it'd be this. I know this is an Amazon device designed to be used in the Amazon universe, and for me this is generally fine. But there are a few things, things I was able to load to my previous Fire from outside the Amazon platform which were useful in how I use the this tablet. I find getting these things into the Fire HD 8 Plus to be far more difficult, and in one important instance impossible to do. I appreciate Amazon's approach to an in-house system, but think they might be turning a number of customers away by not intentionally leaving the door open just a wee bit. Other than this one gripe, I'd definitely recommend this tablet.",,,
8,The browser is still slow. I use this for streaming.  The on/off switch is extremely sensitive.  I have accidentally turned it off several times. The picture quality is good.,,,,
9,,,"At the price I can't complain...too much I had to buy two of these to get one that worked. The first one was a mess. It would not activate Location Services regardless of what I did, including a 1 hour chat session with customer service. Since I couldn't get Location Services to work I couldn't use it for Hulu or any other app that required it, including different weather apps. I returned it and then got another. The second one works fine with the exception of one weather app (WeatherBug). Hulu works as well as AccuWeather. Everything else I have used it for has worked great. Basically that is watching sports on Hulu/ESPN, using the Kindle Reader and casting Amazon music to other devices.No. It is not an iPad. If that's what you want then go and pay for it. I have two iPads and love them both. However my Mini is on its last legs and I wanted something similar without the price tag. This HD 8 fits the bill. The picture quality is excellent for watching live TV or videos. Sound won't blow you away, but is adequate. Battery life is good and charge time excellent. The app choices are fine for my needs and everything loads at a decent speed. 32 GB storage works well for me as I download very little.I could have done without the dud on the first shipment, but Amazon's return policy is the best so overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. It is no more nor less than I expected at the price. If you are interested in one of these then I would go ahead and buy it. If you get it and it doesn't suit then just ship it back. No harm done.One last thought. Note that it only charges wirelessly if you buy the $40 dock. I did not as I'm not sure there is value there for me. I can always get one if I change my mind.",,
0,"These reviews are funny... So while you have people complaining it's lacking features of tablets 700 times more expensive... It's kinda funny they don't mention the things it's missing from cellphones that are cheaper then it.Like screen protector setting for increased sensitivity of the screen. Kinda thought this was standard especially since this gets marketed for kids to play with. Might be hidden and called something weird but I couldn't find it.I wouldn't expect there to be a sim card slot in this Karen and it doesn't have one it's a wifi only tablet. Get yourself a hotspot device for that. Nor is it going to have a gps antenna you utter ninny.Getting google on this took me like all of 20 mins between downloading, security scans and installing. So again Karen aint that hard.Battery life is something I'm concerned with. While it's only used 8% since I opened it... I've been trying to charge it to 100% since then and it hasn't gone up... Normally devices can be used while charging and not drain this much especially with proper adapters and cables.Yeah the adverts can be eye rolling. You'd think with all the information amazon has on us... They'd show us better adverts then click bait games we'd see on Google's in app adverts or services we'd never use. However you can just pay the $15 if you can afford it or just remove them easy enough.Seriously people make customizing this thing sound like homebrew for a console on launch day. There are one click programs and guides for everything on reddit. Grow up and stop being lazy.",,,,

I like love my fire tablet's all 4 of them 8 gen , this is my fifth and 10 gen. hopefully due to (charging stand) that came with it I won't have the problems I had with the last 4 because after about 8 months the the charger got to a point that the USB end of charger cord simply would stay in the fire. Plug it in and it just fell out. Bought new charger had same problem. If I plug it in and it manages to charge it has to be propped up or down or side ways with something to get a biting charge.I like this new one because of the  charging stand and hope that it solves  the problemI had with the others, husband had same trouble with his fire.I haven't used this last one (with stand) enough to see how well it works, but I will update as I go.I must say that for the price fire tablets are great for what I need. I't is Just with having bought 4+1 for hubby which had same trouble, I could have bought one that is very well known . I want to keep my fire tablet rather than learn to use a different brand, heck I am 70years old, old dog new tricks, you know!Hope others try the fire with charging stand and hope you love it, hope it works you and for me.  Also hope Amazon allows this review on line.",,,
2,"Far from perfect, but better than previous generations. I've had previous generation 8"" Fire Tablets, and I was never impressed with them. Besides their limitations, they were slow. I decided to puck up the latest Fire HD 8 Plus because it came with a decent mount of RAM and a faster processor. So far, I'm very impressed. Don't get me wrong, this still isn't an iPad Killer. It is a much better experience than previous generation Fire Tablets though.  Almost everything about it is better, but some things haven't changed. On the negative side, you're still stuck with FireOS although it is now based on Android 9. There still is no official Google Play Store, but it is easily installed if you want it. The screen is is the same as previous versions and not FullHD. It's bright and not awful though. The cameras are still bad, but not a big deal to me. I don't intend to use them anyway. On the plus side, RAM has been doubled to 3GB. Standard storage has increased from 16GB to 32GB. 64Gb is available, and so is external microSD storage. The processor is faster. Batter life is much better. It also has wireless charging and faster charging too.All around, the new Fire HD 8 Plus is a very good budget tablet. I don't love it, but I also don't hate it like previous generations. I actually like it.",,,,
3,,,,,"Unless you just must be ensconced in Amazon's ecosystem I wouldn't recommend it. PROs:Pretty good hardware for the priceNice product designAmazon product so you know what you are getting, easy access to tech support... and it will be easy to return when you quickly realize it just doesn't do it for youCONs:The Fire OS is, simply put, ClunNNnky! And an extremely hobbled version of AndroidPaid extra to remove ads from lock screen? Well, while you use your device you're still going to be bombarded with promotions and pressure to sign up for everything Amazon offers. Even little things that you take for granted on your Android phone for years, you'll have to activate some Amazon service to do that here.For instance, would you like to have a nice bedside clock when you charge your tablet at night (kinda like every other phone or tablet does by default?) Well, you can do that! As long as your willing to turn on Alexa and let it sit by your bed and listen in all night long. Oh, ""that's ok I already use Alexa. Don't be paranoid,"" you say. Well about that clock, yeah well, it will only use about 1/9 of the screen (with no options for any customization of this tiny clock.) The rest of the screen will be used, of course, to show you ads and promote services while you doze off. Don't worry you can get rid of a few of those ads by setting up a slide show of your own pictures! It's easy just sign up for Amazon photos cloud service!I'm sitting here in awe and wonderment of how an Amazon device, running an Amazon OS, using an Amazon created shopping app to shop on Amazon.com could be soooo clunky and painful to use. Am I just spoiled because somehow Amazon's shopping app for regular Androids actually works pretty well?Which brings me to Google Play Store or more accurately the lack of it and thus access to the apps you probably like to use on other devices. YouTube? Roku remote? Nope can't have that on Fire OS. Well not an official one but they do have third party apps made by who knows. Don't like Silk (Amazon's web browser?) Too bad that's the only option. You'll find this scenario a regular occurrence in Amazon's app selection.Summary:I traded in a couple old but barely used Fire tablets to use the funds and a nice trade-up discount to get this new Fire Tablet. I figured I'd give these things one more shot. Certainly by now with a new almost top of the line model it will be an improvement. Something I could use for the basic tasks I'd do with it. It isn't. I'd say it is worse.I returned it less than 2 days after getting it.With these things you are the product. You are the resource. You can pay to remove lock screen ads. You can turn off a lot of the overt data mining but you'll be left with needlessly hamstrung device as a result. And it will still push ads on you. And you can guarantee it is still phoning home with plenty of data points on you.I like Amazon. I do a lot of shopping here and I stream some content. But these devices just don't do it for me. I could look past a lot of these faults if the Fire OS had a better interface and more customization.Bottom line:Maybe the low end Fire tablets are a better value than the el super cheapo no name brand tablets but if you're looking at the upper end Fire tablets I think you'd be happier with a similar price point Galaxy Tab A or a Lenovo product."
4,"So far, so good, mostly Pro - I upgraded from a 8th generation Fire HD 8 because it was too slow for most things.  The new 10th generation one is very fast and much nicer to use.  I added a 512g memory card so I have ton of room to store my media.  I checked connect the device to my account when I bought it and that saved time doing initial setup.  So far I am very pleased with this tablet.  I did purchase the 2 year extended warranty because things do happen.  I only gave the camera one star because I have never used it not because it has problems.Con - I paid the money to remove ads on my old Fire HD 8 and hoped that would transfer to the new one and it did not.  So far the only ads I see on the new one is on the lock screen so I guess I will live with that.  I didn't buy a case for the 10th gen new one hoping I could use the case from my old 8th gen but it was not compatible so the new one arrived today.  I got a blue case instead of a black one I had for the old 8th gen.  My biggest gripe is I can still not install AppleTV, Vudu, or Fandango Now on the new 10th gen.  Amazon should realize all those apps can be installed on an iPad (including Prime video and music) and people like me want to get to all the movies and TV shows they have purchased from their devices. I really hope this will be addressed soon.",,,,

8,"Irritating changes from previous versions and too much extra advertising This is my fourth Kindle and I'm on the fence about liking it. Actually considering sending it back.Negatives: 1. Kindle 8+ is VERY heavy which makes holding it uncomfortable/difficult after ten minutes for those with mature hands or hands with pain conditions. 2. All the features have changed/are now over-categorized which makes finding downloaded books A MAJOR PAIN and requires about six extra steps. I HATE having to search through multiple screens to find my books!!! 3. Books downloaded/borrowed from libraries and publishers (especially pdfs or protected formats) are found in DIFFERENT places from books from Amazon - super irritating, especially if you read or consult many different books a day like I do. 4. Amazon now lists (ahem, 'promotes') a whole lot of other books where you would expect to find books you own or have borrowed - another serious irritation particularly if you have limited bandwidth! 4. The charger cord connection is now different so you will need to buy additional cords for car/office/bedroom if you like/need to charge in multiple locations.Positives: 1. Screen is about 3/4"" larger in height/width from a kindle 7th gen., which makes for easier reading if you use larger fonts. 2. Longer battery life. 3. Improved font/size choices.Summary: meh. Not really pleased except for the improved battery life and larger font options.",,,,

0,,,"Nice but problem with transfring files via cable Update: 6/25/2021 Forgot to add that CS did mention emailing files to the device but that's cumbersome for multiple files.  I ended up using One Drive to move files from my PC to the cloud, then downloaded to the Kindle._______________________________________________________________________________________________________For the most part, I really love this tablet.  Starts up and closes down quickly.  Tons of memory.  I bought it with 64 GB internal and added a 512 GB SD card.  Will take 1 TB but really expensive to buy 1 TB card.  It's more like my old HDX tablet, which is still working BTW.  Similar size but a little thicker.  I think the battery life even exceeds the advertised time.  The first few days I spent a lot of time listening to Audible books and after three days, the charge had barely dropped.I still hate the newer OS on all the latest tablets.  The biggest problem is that I am unable to transfer files to / from my desktop PC using the cable.  First time that's been a problem with Kindles.  My Windows 10 file explorer absolutely refuses to read the tablet.  It displays the device but won't display any of the folders or even the fact that I have internal / SD memory in the tablet.  Just icon one the left side, nothing on the right side.  Customer service didn't seem to understand what I was describing and could only offer canned responses.I also had problems with my Audible downloads disappearing and kept having to re-download every other day.  May have been the format on the SD card.  I reformatted and it seems to be okay so far.Again, I love the difference between my old 7"" Fire and the 8"" Fire.  Fast, great sound, beautiful screen, doesn't take forever to start up and close down (like the 7"" Fire... ugh).  If users just want a Kindle for the basic purpose of reading, listening to music, or watching videos, it's a great tablet.  Software could be a little more user friendly.  Some things have been moved around in the menus, so working between different models can be a little trying.Combining the top menu into the the Library seems pretty useless to me.",,
1,,,,,"Crude Shell of an OS, Lacks Basic Functions for a Device up to 8 Versions Already As a long-time PC user (since the MSDOS days) and 5+ year Apple user, this was my first decision to buy any kind of tablet, and it has been more irritating than fun. If you're buying one just for watching Netflix or basic-b type things like Instagram or Facebook, it's just okay. The first red flag for me should have been the option to get an ad-free unlock screen. It's so unimpressive that they have to run ads or make you pay to get rid of them.For a device which is somehow into its 8th version now, it sure lacks things that should be very obvious features. The biggest surprise was how few apps there are in its app store; it does not allow Google Play store or any other Android or Apple stores/apps, but has its own proprietary Amazon app store and web browser. Won't let you install Chrome, because it requires the Google Play app store. When searching for apps, you get maybe 1 or 2 ordinary ones, and then a dozen filler results that only vaguely match.If making a document, you can only save it to the documents folder and nowhere else, and you can't move documents from it to elsewhere. Doesn't have a native email address system to share out from. If trying to transfer a file from the documents to a cloud service like OneDrive, it doesn't recognize the documents folder and you can't share into the cloud either.As far as my use has experienced, there is no battery warning. You'll be doing something and the device will just go black. Trying to turn it back on, you get the battery symbol flash and have to go charge it. You need to actively remember to Home-screen out of an app that covers the full screen in order to know whether it needs charging, because there doesn't seem to be any low-battery alerts/notifications.It's ""just okay"" as a tablet if all you plan to do is browse Tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, Netflix, or other of the big basic apps, but don't expect very many cool ones. The app store itself looks has the visual impression of a geocities banner advertisement you'd typically ignore -- dull, unimpressive, generic.The permissions you have to give for apps in order to run them are one-shots, where you authorize a bunch of things at once instead of individual permissions for camera/mic/etc separately like Apple does.Battery life seems reasonable, storage seems reasonable, recharge time seems reasonable, quality of the touch screen and graphics seem reasonable. Keyboard is a bit weird, because some things are out of place, and I frequently have to go searching for where more familiar buttons are. The touch sensitivity is not as intuitive/accurate as Apple devices, so you may need to touch in a certain direction to the side/angle to drag something. Seems to have a slight touch-react lag in many cases.Overall, feels like it must have been intended for just rudimentary purposes like reading ebooks and then added an app store or app compatibility as an afterthought and isn't really a serious tablet unless you're just using it for generic media consumption."

3,,"The Best Kindle Fire 8 Yet! I have the previous Kindle Fire 8 and it worked sufficiently well as an e-reader and occasional media browser. I wouldn't have replaced it until I dropped it one too many times and the screen cracked (total user error). So, I bit the bullet and upgraded to the Kindle Fire 8 Plus. And, I'm so glad I did as this model is a great improvement over the last fairly adequate Fire 8 HD. I am impressed especially by the speed of this with 3GB of RAM. Also the screen and heft make this feel like a premium tablet, more akin to other Android tablets of higher price points. If you are on the fence between the previous version and this one, if it's in your budget, spring for the Kindle Fire 8 Plus, you'll be glad you did!",,,
4,,A gift Makes a great gift,,,
5,"Although the same ... it is different. What I did not like about this new product (FIRE HD 8 +), having traded in an older Fire HD 8:1)  The cover I had on the old model was supposed to fit the new model., it doesn't. And none available.2)  I have a longer charging cord for use with my older model. This uses a shorter (USB _C?) cord.3)  My old FIRE HD 8 would ""turn on"" when I opened the case. This one needs the ""on""  button pushed every time, and I need to reach down about an inch into the top of the case - which, as I stated in #1  - doesn't quite fit. This makes it awkward for all the buttons and camera as well. I looked on Amazon and the only case listed for the FIRE HD 8+ is the one I already have -- which doesn't quite fit. The dimensions of the new FIRE HD8+ are slightly shorter and slightly wider. The ""slightly wider"" means the case doesn't close as completely as it did with the old model. And a case specifically for the FIRE HD 8+ doesn't exist.4)  The icons for the apps I have are (surprisingly) not sharp as the older model. It makes it look cheap.Other than these things - the unit seems to work fine.",,,,
6,,,,,"Where's the security I've been using Amazon tablets and products for years.  I was excited to actually have a device without Facebook and thought they were great products.  Until I bought this tablet.  There are no satisfactory/well known antivirus/malware apps for these products.  At first I thought it was a glitch that Amazon was needing to work out with some of the well known developers.  After all they USED to provide security.  No more though - for whatever reason they all abandoned Amazon app store quite awhile ago.  The only ones left (like 2) are not well known and have tons of bad reviews.  Amazon claims their tablets don't need antivirus.Even worse they have discontinued the Shop Amazon app for the previous Fire 8.  I still had protection on that device.  So not interested in shopping on a device that Amazon claims doesn't need protection because its supposedly already installed.  Most likely I'm going back to an Android tablet.  Done with the lack of options from the app store.  Sad too because this tablet was great for videos and nice screen, lightweight, good speakers, ect."

If part of my clothing touches it the screen activates a link or goes to the previous screen viewed.  I have also watched a YouTube video pause, play, pause, play, pause, play, etc when nothing is touching the screen.This makes for a very annoying experience and I will be returning this. I had hoped to use this as a less expensive option than an iPad as my old 9.7 pro is in bad shape.  Instead I ordered the current base model ipad the 64 gigaboogy 10.2 inch 2021 model ipad, since a grand plus for a top model ipad is too rich for my lymphatic fluid.  I may order a different Fire tablet to keep my iPad usage down and make it last longer.  Sadly, I do not trust this model Fire and will not go for a replacement.  Too bad. It is a lot of tech for the moolah.  Hopefully mine was the exceptional experience.",,
8,"Annoying Bits and Bobs, but an above average tablet overall. Negatives-Resolution is noticeably terrible.-Color is wonky, not sure if it is Contrast, Brightness, Sharpness, Gamma, Hue, or Saturation, but it is noticeably terrible compared to my phone, tv, and computer monitor.-You need to download Google Play APKs to run certain things which is inconvenient, but not hard to do.-Special Offers suck. I also didn't see them mentioned on the website where I purchased the tablet. So the $15 fee to turn them off was aggravating. From time to time Amazon still throws adds into my notifications which is rage inducing.-There is a bit of Lag from time to time, but it isn't super terrible.Positives-Touch Screen rarely has problems registering a finger tap or swipe.-Amazon has a large ecosystem that once you log into your account you immediately have access to. This is my first Kindle in 5-6 years and I was able to access movies, magazines, books, music, and audiobooks I purchased all those years ago immediately.-A decent library of apps to start off with. Once you download the Google Play APKs even better.-Works well with Spotify and Youtube Premuim(Google Play APK).A lot of the negatives are upfront nickel and diming, and initial setup. After those get taken care of it becomes an above average tablet. I ended up paying $68.45 during a sale for the tablet and $15+ tax to Amazon to disable the SpEcIaL OfFeRs. $83.45~ish to watch tv, listen to podcasts, and internet browsing.",,,,
9,,,,"Don't waste your money I was in need of a new tablet after an old iPad was no longer updating. I'm not an Apple fan, but the iPad was free and it worked for my purposes. I was almost exclusively using it for streaming apps, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. Occasionally I'd use a browser, but that's about it. Well, when the product is no longer being updated, you can't use apps. So, I asked for a new tablet for a Christmas gift. I didn't specify which one, but my husband knew what I needed it for, he's a tech guy, and I told him to just pick something. Well.. he picked this. I should have known better. In his mind, it did what I needed it to do and it was cheap. I was slightly disappointed, but decided to make the best of it, I'm not that fussy. Right off the bat, I did like the charging dock. However, I did NOT like the size. It is a liiiittle too small for optimal viewing, but again, not that fussy.Worked fine for a bit. Not great, but fine. Sometimes it would lag, had some issues with video quality, but it usually didn't last long. However, over time, I was noticing that I couldn't watch anything. It would try loading for a while and then give me an error. Checked my connections, restart, all the things you normally would do to troubleshoot. Eventually, I needed to connect with dreaded Amazon customer support. Initially got someone that had me check for any updates. I said I had never received a notification that I needed to update and they confirmed that all updates happen automatically, so I wouldn't have received a notice. Ok, check that. Yeah... I'm 10 updates behind. Ok, so can I update? Support had me do a full system restore. Ok, fine. Log back in and they still show 10 updates behind. They can't figure it out. Eventually they have me download the latest system update to my home computer and then physically plug my Fire into my computer and transfer that update to the Fire. Doesn't work. I spoke with 5 different support people and had to explain my issue over and over and over again and each time they told me to buy a new one. Just buy a new one. Trade this one in and pay for another one. WHAT?! You think I want another one of these???? Just let me do these necessary updates? Why can't you do that? Eventually someone stayed on with me long enough to let me click the ""check now"" button under the Updates tab about 139 times and eventually the queue of updates started happening. Like, literally, I just had to sit there (after doing a hard system wipe/reboot twice) and continuously click the ""check now"" button. According to that service rep, one update that didn't automatically happen 10 updates ago, caused a logjam of other updates that also couldn't happen because the previous one didn't start. So I ask, how can I avoid this in the future? Answer: You won't need to, the updates will happen automatically.Cut to a couple months later and I notice a little lag. I resign myself to checking for an update and... wouldn't you know it, there's an update available that most certainly did NOT update automatically as promised.This thing is garbage. Once a week I'll just have to check what updates I've obviously missed and just hope for the best. I will NOT be buying another one of these in the future.",
0,,"Our New Fire HD 8 Our new Fire HD 8 tablet has more than met our expectations. The clarity of the screen is no comparison to the Fire tablets of the past. The new charging stand is well worth the money and is sure to preserve the miniature USB jack in the tablet for a time when it may be needed in the future. As is commonly known, these jacks would simply wear out and lose their connection with the cables from the wall chargers, rendering the tablet useless. The new wireless charging stand is a welcome addition to the Fire device line. Our only dis-appointment came when we tried to down load the existing games that were played in the past. Although the games could be down-loaded, since they seem to be stored in the cloud, the previous scores could not. Seems like a simple trade-off, but for serious Fire Tablet gamers, it was a let down. All in all, if you're looking for a newer, sleeker, device, then the investment in the Fire HD 8 is well worth the money. Good luck with your purchase.",,,
1,,I love my 8 plus fire tablet slate grey ! 😍 So far so good I love my fire tablet. Main reason is I can fit it into any of my purse or handbags. Easy to set up and use not to heavy hand size. I have a 10.1 fire tablet not very easy to carry around when you already have other items in ya purse. 8 plus fire tablet is good for reading too and ya hands won’t get tired holding it. I have to graffiti case to protect it from hard uses. I have the Slate gray colored one. It’s easy to download what like to look at on my tablet. It’s android and it takes a C type charger and cord came with it. I’m sorta ona budget so I got mine at a cheaper price. I’m in love so far. There are other options purchasing your very own tablet. I hope everyone has fun surfing the web and reading ya favorite novels the screen is adjustable for visual preferences. My son has one too I got his for his birthday last year 2020. Bye!👋🏽 Please have fun with your tablet like I’m doing.,,,
2,,"Excellent media consumption tablet! I love my Fire tablet, it’s very affordable and is great for using the Kindle app to read through some books or magazines every night before bed, I keep it right next to my bed on the wireless charging stand, the clock at night is great and being able to use Alexa to control my smart home is even better, the battery life is very good, I often enjoy reading books through Kindle on it at a Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks. The screen looks clear and crisp which is amazing for watching Prime Video or other streaming services. The web browser is a nice touch and works pretty well on it, I mostly use it for books which is why I bought the 8” model. The tablet fits in my hand perfectly great for one handed use. Overall this will do what you need it to do and connect very easily to all your Amazon services like Prime Video, Prime Music and of course Kindle and Audible.",,,

5,"Great device at a great price I have always liked tablets with a screen size of about 8 inches. I find them to be the perfect balance of screen size and portability. I have a 10"" Fire Tablet but the 8 inch is more comfortable to handle and can be handled in one hand. The one complaint many people have is that the Amazon App store does not have everything they need. This can be fixed by installing Google Play. There is a way to do this. Google it and follow the instructions for your model. The screen on the Fire HD is some sort of plastic. I'm not too fond of how it feels but it functions as expected. I put the screen next to my Fire 10 HD and the colors and display on the Fire 10 are more vibrant. The 8"" is better if you are going to take it on a plane or hold it in your hand. The 10"" is better if you are going to set it down on a table. Overall, I like the Fire 8 more.",,,,
6,"Great tablet, great price. I love my Fire Tablet. It doesn't do as much as my other computers. It does do what I use most of the time and it's fast, lightweight, and cheap. It's best for entertainment, though I am able to access Gmail. It does not accept Google Play Store apps. There is a process to make Google apps work that is covered elsewhere in the questions.By the way, I recently needed tech support for my Fire Tablet. My experience with support is that it is better with a phone call to a person. I searched for an amazon customer service phone number. Right at the top of the search page, I saw the Amazon logo and a phone number. I am pretty tech-savvy. I can use the Mac platform as well as PC and Android so I called the number.  The person who answered said that I had won a gift card and he needed my personal information. He sounded like other tech support I have dealt with so I gave it all to him. He transferred me to an obviously bogus cell phone. I called back and, son of a gun, I had won another gift card. When I started to question him, he hung up. I knew I'd been scammed so I got a new credit card and froze my accounts. I found the real support number and solved my issue, thank you. The real number is only one digit off from the bogus one: bogus, 888-280-4341, real, 888-280-4331.",,,,

8,,"Love my new Fire This is a very nice tablet and a great upgrade from the Kindle Fire I first purchased in 2013 - which still works, by the way, except that it doesn't support any new app updates and had gotten very slow.  So I couldn’t pass up the very good deal on Prime Day.  I much prefer a Kindle of this size for reading books. Not too heavy for holding in one hand but big enough to read the print.  My husband has an iPad and I considered that, but I’m a loyal Kindle girl.",,,
9,,Just technology Just like everything,,,
0,,,,,"Not up to older versions of the Fire I have purchased Amazon devices since the very first Kindle reader.  This is the very worst product, bar none, I have ever bought from Amazon.  I do not use this tablet to read books.  I use my Kindle Voyage for that.  I primarily use the Fire tablet as a TABLET, i.e., for e-mail, bill paying, and the internet, where I receive numerous newspaper and magazine subscriptions.  If you wish to use your Fire tablet for the same things, don't buy this one.  I bought this tablet as a replacement for the previous HD 8, 16 gig, which had developed a problem with the charging port and would no longer take a charge.  Other than that, it had been an excellent tablet for my purposes for more than two years.  Amazon said it was unfixable and offered me a 15% discount in a new tablet.  Woo, woo!  Unfortunately, I chose this one, which was scheduled to come out two months later.  Big mistake.  The first major problem was the e-mail program.  Basically, it didn't work.  After going through the hellof contacting my former employer's IT department to get help with setting up the server, I found out that I would get e-mail sporadically, unlike on my laptop, which actually received mail as it came in.  Then, I realized I could not send mail at all.  Composed or return mail just sat indefinitely in the outbox.  I would go to the outbox and retry to no avail.  Sometimes for no particular reason that I could figure out, mail would accidentally get sent weeks after it was composed.  When I contacted Amazon, on several occasions, they said they knew there were problems and they were ""working on it.""  To date, there have has been improvement in receipt of mail, but sending issue has not been resolved.  Also, the Fire e-mail and my laptop e-mail is not synced, I.e., when mail is deleted in one place, it is not necessarily deleted in the other.  None of this was a problem with two previous generation Fires.A recent incredibly annoying problem:  all of a sudden last week, my device went berserk, finally telling me my tablet was not registered and asking me to register it before using.  I got plopped into Alexa blabbing to me about how to use her.  When I would try to go back to home page and start again, Fire would tell me to register again.  I called customer service.  Agent told me we would have to ""deregister"" the device and register it again.  My feeling is that she had no idea what was wrong.  I hesitated because I thought every setting I had would be erased.  ""Oh, no, she said, "" nothing will change."". I took her advice reluctantly.  Spent the rest of the afternoon trying to contact employer IT to set up e-mail again, and days later, I am trying to reconstruct websites, passwords, my Amazon settings, etc.  Hope this doesn't happen again.Other issues:  Amazon customer service not what it used to be, incredibly difficult to reach a human being, hate Silk browser, tablet keyboard too touchy, time for Apple iPad?"
1,"Better with Google added Purchased primarily to use for reading books borrowed from the library that are in format other than Kindle. It works well for reading books, but I did notice the screen faded in and out last night, so be sure to check settings for lighting adjustments.  I was disappointed to discover Google searching wasn't an option, but an online article taught me how to add Google, thus the Google Play Store option on the desktop, where more apps are available than what Amazon offers. This tablet replaced my Samsung GalaxyTab4, which was just eating the battery constantly; the Fire has a longer lasting battery. On the Samsung, I could add a webpage as a desktop link - I wanted to add the local library webpage as a one-tap link. I couldn't figure it out, so I asked the library staff; the librarian told me to ""Tap the menu icon (3 dots in upper right-hand corner) and tap Add to home screen,"" which is not an option (pictured) - still working on that bug. The description says the tablet is expandable to 1T with the micro SD card; what they don't tell you is that card costs more than twice as much as the tablet. I had hoped to load all the music I digitized from CDs onto the 1T micro SD card, but I'm not sure I want to invest in that option. Overall, I am happy with the tablet.",,,,
2,"Awkward and buggy This is my third Fire.  The first was a 7"" and the second a last generation HD 8 which keeps running out of RAM.  So I really was expecting to like this one since it is supposed to be faster and have more memory and RAM.  What I wasn't expecting is the change in placement of the cameras and the fact it keeps hanging up on me.The change in camera placement means the cover opens backwards unless I hold it upside down, but not all vertical apps work upside down.  Holding it upside down puts the volume and power button on the bottom and I keep hitting the volume button with my finger.  The other annoying attribute is it will jump to an ad halfway through a game, but the game timer keeps running.  The old Fire never did that.But I guess the most buggy of all is Alexa will respond to a voice command even with the cover closed and the tablet supposedly asleep.  So when I give the Echo dot a command, this one responds.  My old Fire doesn't do that.  But it won't let me open the Alexa app by tapping on it, so I can't just turn off the voice command, I have to disable the whole app through settings.  Annoying to say the least.I have another few days to decide whether to return it.  I really was excited to get this new Fire but might have to look for a used Gen8 model with increased RAM.",,,,
3,,Great picture quality. This is about the fifth Fire in this household and I think it's the best. I like the size as it is easy to carry around and it charges up rather fast. Just got this one so I need a few more days to find out what all thegood things are on this model.HS,,,
4,,"Bought this for the Kindle, use it like a tablet I was notified my dinosaur of a Kindle was being phased out and decided to get with the current century. I bought this one and and amazed at how this little beauty rolls. I have an iPad and now I use this more than I use that. It's lightweight and had a great battery life. I highly recommend it.",,,
5,,It works great Everything only thing that is off is if you turn the volume down it still ding's at times if you have it down it's for a reason,,,
6,Wonderful tablet! It is wonderful. Slight glare issue.,,,,
7,,,Not sure if it's a refurb First of all the default country was Canada.  I don't live in Canada and bought the tablet off Amazon.com and delivered to a US address. Second the shipping app that comes pre-installed doesn't work. The app loads and within 5secs the Silk browser opens with six tabs. Frustrating.....,,
8,,,"Good for Amazon content - Great Reader Pros....Size is easy to handle.Plays videos well, but not super sharpDownload kids apps for education a big plus for my grandkidsFor the $ 55.00 I paid on sale for a new Prov ersion on sale with 3gb, and 32 gb ram, it is a bargain.Memory expansion is great size capability.ConsNot the fastest tablet.  My phone is much faster when I want to get through things quick for email, news, and articles.Preloaded apps that can not be deleted....Amazon relatedAds coming across too frequentlyDownloading apps from other than Amazon, seems more difficult than usual, if you are able to download at all.  I tried downloading from Playstore, and it gives me messages like it will download later.  I have not seen these apps yet.The camera is low resolution.  Not serious enough for good or great photos.Bottom line.  The tablet is average in my opinon.  If you want to use EBAY, or other non-Amazon services I would avoid this tablet.  Use the generic type Android tablet.  Or confirm you can load other apps you use before buying.  I bought it to help in my grandkids educational content.  But if just for me in a more adult, business situation, I would more apt to buy a generic tablet, faster, and without ads.  There are higher speed tablets out there.  Amazon keeps a tight lid on how to use THEIR tablet.",,

0,,Just about perfect! So glad that I chose the fire eight instead of the 10! The size is just perfect being very close to the size of a regular paper back. It’s light and doesn’t wear my wrists and arms out despite my arthritis. The wireless stand charger is a game changer love love love it.,,,
1,,Good Product Good Product,,,
2,,"Best performance for light activity. The most powerful Kindle Fire yet, the HD 8 Plus, is unparalleled for my purposes. I use it for Facebook and YouTube and rarely anything else. It is lightning compared to my old fire 10, and the new design makes it seem bigger than an 8 inch and much lighter too. I don't even miss the screen space, as the display is far more sharp, clear, and responsive. Facebook blazes like never before, I no longer have hanging or problematic freezes. And the new charger just for it is amazing. The previous fire 10 I had had a short in the charging Pont, so I got the special magnetic charger for it. The charger for the new fire 8 plus is much better. I need not precisely line up magnets, I just drop it in the groove and it charges. And oh how it charges. 25% to 94% in just a little over an hour. I am not a technical person and get frustrated easily. I have used kindle fires a long time now and this, the best one yet, is without a doubt the best one to have. I can't recommend the ease and speed and clarity enough. Even the new 10 does not have the power of the one and only HD 8 plus. This is lightning in your hands for the simple uses an arthritis and chronic pain suffering senior citizen like me. I could not have something simpler or better. I love it. You will too.",,,
3,"Nice tablet for the money This is a good value for the money. It gives you everything you would need for shopping and entertainment such as games and streaming if you are in the Amazon Prime ecosystem or use Hulu, Netflix or HBO Max. I have downloaded a number of videos and music to a micro SD card that I use to view or listen to on the Fire HD Plus although for some reason not all of them are recognized. The biggest downside is there’s no access to the Google Playstore so don’t purchase thinking you will be able to use as a regular Android tablet (at least out of the box). Otherwise, this is a nice small tablet.",,,,
4,"Overall, a great upgrade to the previous generation I had the previous generation, Fire HD 8 tablet.  I was overall very happy with it, except for two things.  Number one, the Audio sucked, bad.  This was actually, my second HD 8 tablet, because the first one had speakers, that sounded that they were frapped, and made crinkling noises whenever I turned up the volume past a certain level.  I called Amazon, and they issued me a replacement.  My new tablet, had audio that DID work, however it still sucked.  Number two, I bought the 16 GB tablet, due to the price.  I did not want to spend much money.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and the lack of memory and overall speed was an issue, and when I saw the newest generation come out, I wanted to fix both these issues.I invested in the Fire HD 8 Plus, 64 GB, in order to fix the audio and the memory issues.  I took advantage of the Trade-In offer, and turned in my previous generation for a 20 percent discount, when I bought my new tablet.I have been very satisfied so far.  The audio is not great, but not bad either.  The HD Fire Plus, has additional RAM memory, and is pretty quick for the price point.  I would recommend this tablet highly, especially if you are looking for a compact, entertainment tablet, that functions for E-book reading, surfing the web, and playing video and games.",,,,
5,"The best Fire tablet currently available Keep in mind that this is my sixth fire tablet over the years, so my review considers some history.  The 8+ fixes some issues the tablets have had for a while, including adding more RAM.  Have 3GB of RAM does make some casual gaming not feel like I'm straining the tablet.  It also makes wireless charging a much-appreciated upgrade.  Pairing the tablet with the charging dock makes this feel like a part of the home and easy to use as a mostly capable Echo Show.I believe the tablet does have some shortcomings that need to be addressed.  The processor feels underwhelming, with a noticeable lag when navigating through Fire OS.  Also, the screen resolution is still sub 200PPI, so you can still see some pixilation, or the screen text isn't as fine as it should be.  My original Kindle Fire HDX had a screen resolution above 300PPI, and the processor felt more than capable.At the end of the day, I believe the purpose of the 8+ is a content consumption device.  This device succeeds in that regard.  All your entertainment apps play great, with long battery life to not have to worry about charging.  The browser is built on Blink which means it has no problems surfing the web.  The email app is anemic but does the job.  Overall, I believe the Fire HD 8+ is the current flagship of the Kindle line and is the one that I would recommend.",,,,
6,,,,,"Its an ok Tablet. Its just a netflix, kid distracting, e-book reading tablet, thats it.The camera on it is garbage, there is no flash. Bare bones features on the camera.The fact that it doesnt have google as a search bar nor Google Plat Store App absolutely kills this.There is hardly anything on the Amazon App store and the few ting on it are knoc-off apps that barely even work.I couldnt even get and Alarm app that worked. It cant even do Alarms.The battery life aint great on it, which is surprising considering its not doing half of the things a phone does.The screen quality is fine, but disappointing. For example Facebook looks better on my phone that on here. I watch a facebook book video on my phone and it looks well, i see the same video on facebook but on this and its jagged. Over all, Colors are a kinda washed out, especially blacks. Again, its relatively ok, at the end of the day, but you already had phones with significantly better screen/image quality than this.But worst of all, is actually the abysmal volume on this thing. Again... my $140 phone sounds louder and clearer than this.I never had a tablet before. I did gift one to my 7 years ago from that Korean tech company that starts with an S, and that thing was great. This Amazon Tablet, is my first tablet for me, and i was under the impression tech on Tablets had progress, but i guess maybe not on this one.This is for distracting kids. Not for an Adult who has stuff to do."
7,,"Nice I don't know a lot about my Kindle tablet yet as I just got it.  Not a lot of instructions except on line, but still a lot of questions.  I also got the wireless charger.  I'm excited about it and will have to start using it more and more after the end of the month.",,,
8,,Great I bought this tablet for my daughter and set it up with Amazon kids and she absolutely loves it.,,,
9,"Great, affordable tablet I got rid of an iPad that never played well with the internet and replaced it with the Fire HD 8 plus tablet, What a difference! Both the Amazon Silk browser and the side-loaded Chrome browser load quickly, and internet searches are smooth as silk. The Fire HD 8 plus is also wonderful for reading e-books, and because it is lightweight, I can comfortably hold it in one hand while reading. All of the apps that I had downloaded so far, both from the Amazon App Store and Google Play (sideloaded), work beautifully, except for the calendars (Amazon's native calendar and Google Calendar), with which I have been having trouble syncing my Exchange calendar. (The calendars associated with my Gmail accounts sync fine.) But given that I have access to all my calendars on my phone and computers, this isn't a show-stopper. The Amazon App Store has a good selection of apps, but I am attached to certain Google apps, so I was relieved to see that I could sideload Google Play. There are ample instructions on the web/Youtube for how to do this, which involves obtaining four files from the APKMirror website and downloading and installing them in a certain order. I managed to identify, download, and install the right files, and Google Play works great. But be warned that the process is confusing and requires patience. But overall, I am very happy with the quality of this tablet, especially for the price!",,,,
0,"Christmas present '21 I've had this tablet since December of last year, it's held up pretty okay. The size of the screen is decent as well.

1,,"Great small tablet for an affordable price Let’s face it, you can’t compare the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet to an Apple device, a Microsoft tablet or an Android powered tablet (etc) if that is what you are looking for, do not purchase this tablet.Yet the new Fire HD is good entertainment and powerful to do what it was intended to do, visit Amazon programing and it’s  products.I really enjoy it, any movies I have purchased with Amazon video I can load on the tablet, works with Alexa, I can watch Netflix, Hulu, You tube, and most of all read books, this is replacing my first generation kindle fire,That still works, (slow)Is really simple, if you enjoy Amazon for what it does, then the Kindle Fire is a great companion.if you need a different product to surf the web or do other things. By all means purchase it, yet for the price of this Fire HD I can do all I need,Play a game, order from Amazon, Disney channel+, sling, showtime, Starz, Pandora, tweeter, zoom, facebook, instagram and more.The reason I purchased the Plus, was all technical, extra memory and the ability to charge by a docking station.And I added a Micro SDHC card of 64gb for extra storage capacity.All for a reasonable price.Bottom line, I did not buy it to surf the web, I have other devices/laptop/desktop/phoneIt’s for entertainment and travel.Can go with you during a flight, airplane mode and watch your favorite show/movie play a game, read a book or listen to a podcast that you saved or own,Do I recommend, “YES”",,,
2,,,"Love Hate Relationship Good hardware and amazing price but their default UI is absolute garbage. It reminds me of the old days of AOL and MSN when you went to their main page. They used to fill the homepage with so much garbage that I didnt want to use them. This is why so many people moved to Google back then. No ads, no marketing, no stuff I dont want on my device. This is even more acute if you have kids.For kids, I dont want all those apps, not even the ones designed for kids (they are garbage too) and when it comes to the parent controls, they are an absolute travesty. Some of the worst I have ever seen and complicated by pay walls and hard to find settings for no reason aside from a clear attempt to gather data on the user and push marketings/ads. This is not good at all. They need to cut it out. It should be as simple as a blank desktop that I add a few apps to. Then lock out the kids from adding anything without a password. Thats it. None of the other garbage is needed or wanted. It would also be nice if I can just save a few movies on there and have them work without doing gymnastics to make them work out of the box.So yea, their GUI is horrendous. Most GUI's are trash so thats not surprising but the 1st thing I do with these devices is I wipe them and just put generic Android on top. Its 100% better that way.",,
3,"Good, but still a lot of room for improvement This is a good kindle-....not as great as I was expecting though. The download speed for books is really slow - like 10 minutes sometimes. I have considered it may be my internet, but since no other product takes that long, I have to think it is the kindle. The sound for the Audible books is ok as long as you are not doing anything besides listening right next to the kindle. I got Audible so I could do other things, so I am using a small speaker that plugs into the kindle. Much better, but still a smaller range than I require.  I have used it for music outside and the volume range is the same as the book. Maybe I expect too much.  I do love being able to use more apps on this kindle and the nice size of the screen. It does not work outside in any sort of glare environment though!!!  I have found one or two set up features that are not user friendly, but are needed to fully support the user.  The screen response is not as sensitive as I would like either. It takes 3-4 times to get the kindle to respond.",,,,
4,,"A true bargain when it's on sale I bought the HD 8 plus a few months after the model became available. It has proven to be fast, reliable, resilient and reasonably versatile. As the obvious favorite web browsing device in an infotainment heavy household, the device is in use at least 10 hours each day. It has survived multiple falls, one from nearly 6 feet, without a scratch but obviously a good quality protective case is a must. I added a Samsung a7 lite tablet (~$130 on sale) to our stable of devices over the 2021 Good Friday weekend. I have been surprised at how much better the HD 8 plus' user experience is compared to that competitor even though on paper the Samsung's CPU and RAM are superior.  The HD 8 plus provides faster and smoother browsing and is simply a more stable platform overall. To be fair, the Samsung's screen display is crisper and more vibrant. When Amazon runs one of its periodic 50% off sales, you would not regret snagging a HD 8 plus.",,,

7,,Unhappy So I purchased this kindle a little over a year ago. This is not my first Kindle so I was happy to get an upgraded version. Six months later and it is very slow and the battery doesn’t last as long as the older model. I have to tell you that I am very disappointed and don’t think I will ever buy a Kindle again!,,,

The picture is great for watching tv, movies, or even listening to your favorite music. I use it mostly for reading and watching a show now and again without having to charge up the battery. Great thing about battery charging is how fast it is. If I had to mention any cons it would be that to me it is a bit on the heavy side since I am usually holding it with one hand when I'm reading. It would also be nice to have a little more room to have on the sides to hold it so you aren't always accidently touching the screen. All in all I would say if your on the fence about purchasing this item....GET IT!!",,

5,,"Great value to cost ratio First and foremost, I like the value/cost ratio.Prior to purchasing this on the October Prime Day, I had been using an 32Gb HD8 7th gen that I bought in 2017.  I was moderately satisfied with it but wanted something a bit snappier and decided to try the 10th gen 64Gb HD8 Plus.  I am NOT the least bit sorry for the decision.This device is much faster and smoother than the older one.  The battery life is far better, the bluetooth is better and more consistent, the screen is brighter, the USB C connection and wireless charging is excellent upgrade.  IMO, the wireless charging alone is worth the extra cost for the Plus model.I wear hearing aids with bluetooth. I was pleasantly surprised that the paired with the new HD8 PLUS!  Wow, this was very nice!  The older hd8 would not do this.I also purchased the Amazon HD 8 cover for the new tablet and was pleased to find that all 3 of my QI wireless pads for our android phones and they all function flawlessly with the HD8 Plus.I installed Google Play Store on the unit and virtually every app I have downloaded has worked without any problems.  This was not the case with the earlier 7th gen model.I am very pleased with the device, it's a very good upgrade over the older version.  I would make the same choice again, only with much less hesitation.I hope this helps!",,,
6,,Got a different stand then I thought Thought it was going to be a stand to stand the tablet up on a table,,,
7,Great Fire except for one thing. VOICE VIEW SUCKS. Love this Fire Tablet except for one thing. The “text to voice” on other Fires or Kindles is not there. Yes  “Voice View” is available but is VERY ANNOYING as voice view announces everything you do and takes two clicks to turn on and off.  I want the SIMPLE Text to Voice On my Fire 7 tablet and Kindle readers If you are purchasing the Fire 8 to read or have the “Fire” read to you on occasion don’t. The Voice View sucks.  If I weren’t going to use this Fire for things other than reading I would send it back.,,,,
8,Pretty amazing despite Amazon won’t let ur download apps like Snapchat I use it for all kinds of stuff gaming is great on ur picture quality and screen resolution are exceptional and battery life on this thing is insane just wish it supported Snapchat and stuff if it did i definitely would’ve given it 5 stars,,,,

1,,,"I feel ripped off with zero response! And an UPDATE! I can’t really speak for anything other than screen quality. It arrived on July 2 around 8 pm. Didn’t open until July 3 morning. Scratches on screen. Called amazon - they wanted to send a refurbished one to replace my brand new, unused one!!  Unacceptable. Have been promised repeatedly that this is being escalated to be taken care of. Lots of promises of emails & call backs-but empty promises as I have gotten no where!  I am about to run out of time for return-plus to order another it will be more $ as I purchased when on sale!! You would think amazon would stand behind an amazon product especially-but NO!!  I am an avid amazon shopper- spending $$ there daily!  If & when I’m about out of return window they will be getting my entire order - Fire HD8 plus, extended warranty, screen cover & case back!  I have not touched any of it since opening & finding the scratches within 12 hours of receiving it on July 2. It is now July 15!UPDATE:  Amazon finally took care of my issue and sent me a new (not refurbished) tablet.  What I have tested out so far works great.  I especially wanted this to for the show mode to hook up to our Arlo security cameras.  The tablet hooked up to the system seamlessly and automatically!!  Now I can see exactly who/what is around my house in the middle of the night thanks to the Fire HD 8 plus tablet.  As others have stated, I do feel the original size/shape of the 8 is better and easier to hold in your hands.  It is faster than my older 8.  I don't really like how I will have my clock/date/temp set on my screen at bedside and after a while that switches to an advertisement/tips for Alexa - one of my main uses besides show mode & reading is using this as a clock.  I can no longer wake up in middle of night & look to see what time it is because the clock gets replaced by an Alexa tip.  Overall, my experience receiving the tablet was horrible, but the tablet itself is nice & definitely worth the $79.99!",,
2,,"Best version of the Kindle Fire I have bought in years. Enjoying the new Fire 8 + tablet. Changes since I had a version 7 are very nice, and of course availability of new apps and programs make it a fun way to surf the 'Net without sitting a PC! If you haven't purchased one yet, put it on your holiday list.",,,
3,"Brightness settings unstable while streaming; Old Fire 8 (2017 version) displays better While the new Qi-charger is very effective (but a bit of a space hog) and the faster chip and 64 GB are nice, the particular tablet I have has some performance issues. After streaming 3 episodes about 40-50 minutes each, the battery drops from 100% to between 75-80% - my old Fire Tablet was less battery hungry. The plus point is that the wireless charging is fast and efficient - much faster recharge than the old tablet. What really bothers me is the fluctuating brightness while streaming. One minute it's dark and the other it's bright. This is consistent behavior regardless of where I am streaming from whether Prime or Netflix. Just to be sure that it wasn't weird photography, I have watched the same series on my TV and my computer screen and there is no fluctuating brightness which appears to be random on the tablet. Reading is a joy as ever, although this tablet is significantly heavier than my old favorite 8"" Fire. The heaviness makes it more stable for viewing media but feels a bit of a burden when reading.  I was sold by the idea of this tablet and its accessories but am less than 100% on board with the performance. Let's just say I am not abandoning my old favorite well-loved 2017 8"" Fire tablet any time soon.",,,,
4,,,,"Device Dashboard drives me crazy! If it wasn't for the Device Dashboard ""Touchpoint"" that sits at the bottom left of the screen, EXACTLY where your thumb sits when holding it, I would be pretty happy with my Kindle Fire.  Note:  This ""Touchpoint"" is only used to control devices connected to Alexa.  It is level with the face of your device and not raised at all.  It auto-rotates when you change the position you hold the Fire in and is ALWAYS EXACTLY where your thumb naturally sits while holding the device in your left hand.  Most of us hold the device in our left hand so that our right hand is free to be used for everything else we do.  This Touchpoint doesn't show in any of the pictures I've seen of the device, but in relation to the pictures, it is to the left of the small arrow/round dot/square spot that you can see near the bottom of the device in the little black area that looks almost like the frame, but is actually part of the screen.The sensitive area of the Touchpoint is quite a bit larger than the picture of it. Again, it is only used to control all of the devices you have set up with Alexa.  You barely touch it and it launches.  Even rolling your thumb a bit will launch it.  You can NOT disable this Touchpoint and it is extremely annoying to accidentally touch it while playing a game or watching a movie as it immediately leaves that screen and goes to the Dashboard (Alexa controller) screen.  When you go back to a game you were in the middle of, it requires you to watch a stupid (but very brief) ad before you can resume your game.  If you were watching a movie, you have to take the time to touch the ""resume watching"" Touchpoint and wait for it to restart.The device is determined that you use this feature.  This Touchpoint only has ONE function and that it to control the things like smart sockets/lights/etc that you have connected to Alexa.  I have even disabled Alexa, but  the device still activates the Device Dashboard with the briefest of touches even if your thumb just barely touches the edge of the area surrounding the button.This Touchpoint is so sensitive, that putting electrical tape, or paper, or even a piece of a rubber eraser on it, will not prevent it from immediately launching the Device Dashboard if you touch even the area surrounding the little picture on the Touchpoint.The unit also has one other annoying feature.  It is the fact that the Kindle book reader app also wants to be active.  I have a Kindle Paperwhite that I use for reading.  I don't want to use my Fire for this but the Fire still has access to my books even though I have tried to eliminate this by not having it on my device list associated with my books.Other than the size of the screen, I much prefer using my smartphone for this kind of thing and I am seriously considering selling my Kindle Fire even though I've only had it for about a month.By the way, Alexa listens and records what it hears even when the device is shut off.  I am NOT making this up.  If you read the privacy statement and Terms of Use Agreement, it tells you this.  The only way to prevent this is to disable Alexa.  (Note that removing the battery should also disable the whole thing, but of course that is NOT an easy thing to do as it requires a special tool.)",

The only con I see is the battery life, could have been better but for the given price and config, no complain as such. Better then the over priced Samsung ones.Update: After 7 months of usage, there is has been one thing that’s been bugging a lot during the overall course of my usage and that is placement of power button next to volume. There is a very good change that u might turn off the screen while trying to lower the volume.",,,,
0,,"Way to Go Amazon 💖 OMGEE! I love my new Fire HD 8 Plus Tablet! I kept tossing the thought of purchasing this new one because I have the Fire HD 8 (6th generation 2016) and it has worked perfectly for me all these years! Other than my cell phone, I had used my 6th generation continually like my 2nd skin! Well, the battery life was starting to dwindle and began taking it longer and longer to charge!In other words, it became more of a necessity to purchase a new tablet. I had searched and reviewed many tablets, both 8 and 10 inches, looking for one to my liking! While continuing my search, I was notified that the new Fire HD Plus was going to come out soon. I didn't know if I wanted to continue my ""Amazon Fire"" family of products (I'm also a Samsung Android gal)..... but really loving my HD 8 6th generation, I gave in and purchased the new HD 8  Plus and I'm even happier than I ever was!This tablet is a tad bit smaller than my other one.... but Ohhhh sooo much faster, quality of viewing is superb and the battery? Amazingly awesome!Soooo, am I happy with my purchase? ABSOLUTELY! 💖 Would I recommend this tablet? DEFINITELY!BTW, I even found a case for it that performs like my old one! I love the feature of going to sleep when I close it and awakens when I open it!So if you're on the fence as I was with the decision of purchasing this tablet... take the leap.... you won't be disappointed one iota... I can promise you that!",,,
1,,"Inexpensive 8 inch tablet that can be an Android tablet and operate like an Amazon Echo Show... For me it's the perfect form factor for a travel tablet -- relatively small and light weight, inexpensive and flexible.  This Fire tablet can be turned into a regular Android tablet -- just visit youtube for the steps necessary.  Then load your favorite Android apps through the Google Play Store.  If you spring for the Wireless Charging Dock for Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus Tablet, you can leave it in the dock and it will behave like an Amazon Echo Show.  I don't read Kindle books for which this tablet was designed.  I leave it in the dock and grab it when I travel to use it like you would any Android tablet.",,,
2,"Limited on font sizing but perhaps much more battery charging flexibility I like the size of this Kindle - I have a Fire and a smaller kindle abs I definitely prefer the larger size. One detail about this one that I don’t care for is, I can’t seem to enlarge the font of books I am reading. I went to settings and I’m on the largest available setting - the pic above shows that the type isn’t that large. My old Kindle fire would allow me to make the font size as large or small as I needed.Another good point is I believe- not 100 percent sure - but it seems I can change the battery before it gets to zero, without that pesky battery memory thing. My other two kindle no longer stay chanted very long and I think it’s cause they had to be dead before charging and you have to charge to 100% for optimum battery life. There was no info about the battery in the small info sheet that came with this new version. Hopefully this is the caseHere is to hoping this new Kindle brings me as much enjoyment as my past three have",,,,

5,"KINDLE IS NICE BUT ADVERTISING TO MUCH I really like the kindle but the advertising does take away from its usually lovely screens. I didn't realize I ordered the one with advertising. Oh well.  Its fast and easy to operate. The quality of the pictures is great. I couldn't play some of the games, I will have to download new ones. You can't use the ones you already have in your cloud. I love the charger it is great. I didn't get the cover for it they are out of stock.  I recommend the Kindle 8 Plus but get it without the advertising and 64 G.",,,,
6,Much better! I wasn't going to buy a third Fire tablet after the first two had both died of the same issue: no longer accepting a charge (due the inherent flimsiness of the micro-USB charge connection). I had even bought a magnetic charge plug system for the second one but it didn't help it last any longer than the first.What got me to make this purchase was the (optional but IMO mandatory) wireless charging base! It even works with the tablet still in it's protective case!,,,,
7,,Battery life Battery life,,,
8,,"Great price for a very good tablet. The tablet can't be beat for the price. The screen quality, speed, storage are excellent as long as you aren't expecting it to function like a $300 device. I am tied to the Amazon/Fire environment, but I haven't had any issues with that. I download and read books from my local library using Libby, watch any one of the many streaming services I subscribe to, and linked my Gmail. I can even access my YouTube account if I want to go through a few extra steps.  On top of that, the build quality is great. Really, I'm not sure what the people with negative reviews were expecting or have to be unhappy about, but for $50 this tablet is a steal!",,,
9,,"Great Tablet I bought the new Fire 8 Plus 64GB for the battery life as I have a first generation Fire 7 which still works well but the battery doesn't last more than a few hours and recharging takes a bit. I like the extra inch but this new one is very light and thin. The battery life is great so far I have even gone below 50 percent after many hours of usage and just lay it on the wifi charger which charges quickly. Was so easy to set up and like the slate color very nice.The new configuration and Alexa is quite nice as I can find what I need quickly, does everything I expected. I like to sit down in the evening to read a book or magazine, play a card game, watch a pod or curiosity tv, read some web articles and this perfect. The HD display is a great feature as well as the option of extra GBs now, better storage capability.My opinion it's a great value and if this Fire lasts as long as my other which is now my husband's it's a super value. I have a PC and a laptop do do more productivity based applications. I want my Fire to do exactly what it does and an easy take along in a packpack or download a book to read on a long car ride,  meets my needs perfectly.",,,
0,,"Definitely Worth the Upgrade from 8th Generation. I traded in my year old HD8 (8th generation) as the offer for this new HD8 Plus was so attractive. Absolutely no regrets. This is my fourth Fire Tablet so the product is a known commodity. I know I am getting a tablet that does what it does but within the limits of its Amazon sphere. I am ok with that. I had traded up from my HDX9 to get that HD8 8th gen, and it was a disappointment. Yes, it had a newer processor than the HDX, but weaker screen clarity, cheap sounding speakers, and I still found the Silk browser clunky. Reading the reviews on the HD Plus, I was willing to give this new model a try. And so glad I did. The speakers are much better. The screen is not a HDX but it is sure better than the previous model. And the extra ram and improved processor does make a difference in the Silk. The other difference i really enjoy is though it is 8"" tablet, it is easier to hold for reading and viewing. Its a bit wider than the HD8 8th gen while keeping the same size screen so the balance when holding it is much easier. The other one was too narrow. This new size reminds me of the layout of my original Fire way back when. Nice job Amazon on the redesign. Battery life seems maybe a bit better. Not that noticeable an improvement, but then I am used to regularly charging. All in all I'm very glad I upgraded.",,,
1,,Excelente Increible,,,
2,"Overall very pleased but for two things . . . When my HDX 8 recently died I set my sights on the new Fire 8 plus with it's USB C quick charge, expandable storage, wireless charging capabilities and the new Google Search app. It's been 2 weeks and so far I'm pleased although I had to give it only 4 stars for two reasons. 1) In Amazon's effort to reduce size and weight, the width of the non-screen area around the edge is noticeably narrower, not even as wide as my thumb and I have extremely small hands. This makes it hard to grasp without actually touching the screen. When reading, pages get turned when they shouldn't all the time. I read a lot. 2) I'm also constantly turning the darn thing off accidentally. The power button is right where my hand goes and it's also too close to the volume buttons. It seems like these tablets were designed to be held vertically (with the volume and power buttons on top) which makes no sense at all since streaming videos is one of the huge selling points. Who holds their tablet vertically when watching a movie or video? I'm sure in time I'll adjust but I shouldn't have to. These are not deal breakers but are very irritating.",,,,

Fácil de llevar, excelente la conexión a mis audífonos y aparatos de audio Bluetooth....me encanta el modo “noche” para evitar el cansancio de mis ojos cuando leo un libro en kindle. Me sorprendió tanto que deje de lado mi IPad. Ahora, si bien no trae la play store, siguiendo los pasos a través de internet la puedes instalar y listo, todo el mundo en tu tablet fire. Esta ha sido desde mi punto de vista y experiencia una gran compra y difiero de los comentarios negativos que he leído de ella, de hecho ya tengo en mi lista de compras otras para mis hijas. He manejando y tengo diferentes marcas de Tablets y esta, para ser de gama media me ha dejado muy sorprendido!!...bien por Amazon.....el navegador web llamado  AMAZON SILK es muy completo y puedes usar cualquier buscador por defecto, ya sea Google, Bing, Yahoo y otros.

6,,"Finally, the kitchen tablet I have been waiting for.. I have tried at least four different tablets in my kitchen over as many years including Sony, iPad, LG and Samsung.  This one finally hits the sweet spot, primarily because of it's smartly designed wireless charging stand and integrated Echo Show Mode.  What I have wanted is a tablet that I can leave at rest in a charging state, but quickly pick up and move around the kitchen when I am working on recipes.  Other tablets with integrated charging stands usually rely on pogo pin connections, which are touchy and unreliable.  You need them aligned just so to get it to charge. Moreover, none of them are stable if you are trying to use your tablet as a touch device when docked.  For example, the Samsung Galaxy s6 wiggles and wobbles when ever you touch it in its charge stand. The Fire Table charge stand is so sturdy and stable, I just plop the tablet on it, flip the tablet cover over the back and I am certain it is charging and ready to use.  It does not budge when tapping on the screen.  What I want is a device that I don't have to think about or fuss with when i want to use it.  It just works, consistently, all the time.Echo show mode is an added bonus, when plopping the tablet on the stand, it immediately goes into show mode, displaying time and weather, all the time, and is ready to respond to whatever question you have.  Like, ""Alexa,  what song is playing right now?....""",,,
7,"Wow, the new 8 inch version is fantastic PROS: This one is the HD Plus with 3GB memory (that's working memory, not storage space), and that makes ALL the difference in app performance, even if the CPU isn't much improved.  Indeed, it's the best tablet I've seen for the price.  The sound is good enough for me.  I use this exclusively to play StarDew Valley, and it works super well for that, lasting several hours in game, which is impressive.  And for me it charges in 2.5 - 3 hours, which is even better than the 4 they say!  I don't use voice stuff like Alexa so I can't comment on that, but it's cool that it's an option.  Not having it enabled saves battery, so I suggest saying ""No"" to Alexa at initial setup.CONS: The screen is poor quality and fuzzy, the power button is way too close to the volume buttons so you're constantly turning it off accidentally (HATE that since it feels like and is the the same size and shape).  And the menu system is super confusing and makes finding stuff like the browser and Settings apps a huge pain.Overall, it's very well worth the price.  And the 8 inch is so much easier to hold and look at up close while lying down, so I say do that instead of the 10 incher.",,,,

9,,,,,"Deliberately Crippled compared to Fire HDX7.  Loss of Txt to Speech.  Optimized for Alexa. I have 10 Kindle Fire and 7 Kindle readers. I have bought all most every Generation.Pros. -  Decent screen. Fast.  a USB-C connection, and a modest speed increase.Con-Seems to have become more Amazon orientated limiting other content.Drops DOCUMENT importation.Drop simple USB transfer of files from your PC.Drops Txt to Speech.Menu's are Alexa optimized. Making it difficult to search.Alexa will not read all books.  Requiring you to BUY AUDIBLE version.ALSO if you are not INTERNET connected ALEXA will not work.Alexa sometimes will not work in screen saver mode or docked or when ads are displayed requiring you to pick up and push the power button.  Just pushing power button in dock sometimes doesn't work.  YES  amazon had dropped the txt to speech.  you have to use alexa to read (play) a book.  Which can take repeated attempts to get Alexa to find it.  Very Very Frustrating.  Just imagine sitting in  waiting area of an office and saying Alexa Play book  ""Everyone Loves Big CHESTS by MorningWooD..""Screen reading has been dummed down and now very ROBOTIC and  irritating  voice. Making it basically unusable to read txt to speech.  Basically the voice has reverted to the level of 2nd gen Kindle.Variable Volume button.  Depending on orientation volume button works differently.Poor speakers.  Much less volume than HDXHeavier a little bit. with less resolution than HDXI have also had problems with several blue tooth headphones.  All of a sudden volume will increase out of the blue.  Might just be my cheap headphones.Blue tooth connectivity.  Prev HDX would connect automatically. Now if switching a blue tooth, sometimes have to go into the menu to reconnect a previous device. Sent multiple books to device from email. I have 900 Books from Baen.com  They show up on other devices but not on this one. Which makes me feel like Amazon wants you to buy their versions only and trying to force you to also buy AUDIBLE versions.  I like to read a lot of Kindle unlimited. I wouldn't pay $8-$14 to listen to it on audible.I own two KINDLE HDX.  The only reason I decided to upgrade was due to power connector having trouble charging and TWICE now both resetting to factory condition without my input.  I usually kept one powered down so when one ran low on battery I would switch and charge the other one.  I read /listen to Txt to speech voraciously.  When one reset losing all my photos/docs/Email.  I thought i would just restore from backup.  Nope all gone.  Then turned the other one on and mysteriously it reset itself to factory condition a few hours later.Got the hint so decided to buy the new version.  Well I can't recommend.  Will be returning and buying a regular tablet.When my prev versions die will be last kindle I buy unless Amazon decides to restore features."

1,"Great for pattern reading, hit and miss with games I wanted a Kindle for the longest time to not just keep my ebooks collection in one place, but to store the knitting and crochet patterns I purchase in one device I can freely access while working on a project. For the most part it does great as a reader, and the graphics in the books and patterns are really colorful and sharp. There was one issue that I do notice in playing games downloaded from the Kindle App Store. I like to play Township, but the kindle processor doesn't seem to like it. It is like the processor is slowed down when dealing with the game graphics, say you are entering the game...for whatever reason, the words and graphics in the welcoming screen jumble up into a miss-mash of scrambled words and scrambled scene as if the processor is running seconds behind showing you the game interface. Am satisfied with 90% of what I wanted the Kindle to do for me, its primary weakness is being able to run the more involved role playing games like Township with the limitations of its processor. It was fine on more simple games like Clockmaker and Zen Koi.",,,,

My favorite app, Magic Puzzle has little to nothing of My purchases on My app. I had a lot of puzzles I had purchased, with cash and coins. Now I have to watch ads and get interrupted with pick a card games. I very disappointed in this aspect. My Freeflows', I had unlimited hints on all of them, I paid for that also. Now I have to pay for them. I had My old Kindle for about 10-11 years. I had no problems with it, but I didn't have facebook on it either. I would like to know why Amazon is working with Google and facebook to make everyone connect to Facebook?What is with all the ads? I spend more time with your ads then I do with the apps. If I'm trying to relax and play a game, it's very frustrating to play. Then if I don't want them I have to pay to get rid of them. What's up with that?I still resent the fact that Google crashed My old Kindle in the first place. And why do I need to be connected to Facebook with everything? So, My next question is, Is Amazon working with Google?",,,
4,,"Great portable entertainment center This is a great device for its purpose, which is media.  I don't even try to use it for work or email or anything productivity-related, but for videos, books, music and some games, it's great.  I use it as an alternate entertainment system when I fly, in the frequent events my seatback monitor doesn't work or doesn't have anything worth watching.  With the SD card you have almost unlimited storage to download movies, songs, etc. from your favorite services -- I've got a ton of stuff from Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu and more stored on it -- and the battery life is great.  The one drawback is that it takes a long time to charge but that has yet to be a real problem for me.  You can also easily load the Play store on it and get access to all Android apps including Chrome.",,,
5,,,"frequent Audible crashes very inconvenient I switched to this Fire version because it offered wireless charging, and prior Fire 7s all started having difficulty getting a secure connection for charging. I loved this wireless feature and so was reluctant to return the device. Therefore, I went through many hours and sessions, and two replacements, trying to fix the one constant, annoying problem described below.  Customer reps were friendly but all acted like my problem was new to them and had to be reviewed by the very best folks on the staff.When playing Audible audiobooks (tried dozens of them purchased over the past several years), play would stop arbitrarily (crash) many times a day, after varied periods of time, from a few minutes to over an hour. The screen would revert to a page like the one downloaded -- showing just 0:00 on the time elapsed line and Chapter 1 of 1, with no image of the audiobook cover. Then, I would have to find the icon for the book to restart it, and it never started to play at the location of this crash. It usually went back to where I had last started. This happened to three Fire 8 HD Pro devices in a row.The same audiobooks play without a problem on my Mac Book Pro.  And, audiobooks from other sources were fine.Audible Technical and Amazon customer service tried lots of tricks, and got back to me several days later after seeking advice, but none worked and I was told they had no fix now, but maybe with a future generation.There were many times when stopping what I was doing to restart the book was not practical. Since listening to audiobooks is a near-constant behavior for me, I decided to return the device for a refund and go back to using a Fire 7.Otherwise, my use of the internet and kindle books worked well, as with previous Fire devices.",,
6,,"Love it!  Neat little tablet at a great price! Crisp clear responsive screen, decent camera and good sound.  An extremely good price for this versatile little tablet.

7,"Dashboard Annoyance I like the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet.  I previously had a 2013, 7"" Fire HDX that was perfect, but discontinued.  The major flaw in the Fire HD8 (and HD10 Plus) is the icon location for the dashboard feature.  It is extremely inconvenient, and I accidentally turn it on frequently.  Touching the icon causes the device to leave the page you are on and go to the Dashboard thus interrupting reading, games, internet, messenger, etc.  I don't even use the dashboard so it's also a useless feature for me.  If you use it, great but the icon location is still awful.",,,,
8,,,"Good for the price Cheaper option than buying a high performance tablet.  It does everything well enough for casual use, so why spend a lot more unless you need to?  Sound is still too quiet and directional in the 2020 model.  The speakers have to have a surface to bounce off before you can get suitable audio.  They have moved the power and volume buttons to the left, upper corner - big mistake!  Now attempting to change tablet position or hold it up with your left hand on that corner hits all three buttons.  They are also still using FAT32 file format for micro SD cards and probably should update to exFAT.  I also highly recommend you pay the extra $15 for ""without special offers"".  I know what you're thinking...  you don't mind swiping away a few advertisement screens to save a few bucks.  I have to tell you though, if you're planning to use it over the next few years, removing that constant, minor inconvenience is worth fifteen bucks.  As for which one to get, you'll find that the Plus model is faster, but don't expect a huge speed increase.  If you're a Qi wireless charge user - hands down buy the Plus model!  I love charging both my phone and my tablet on the same pad with no wires!  Wireless charge time is still pretty quick at an hour or two.  I went caseless on my Plus just for wireless charging, but I have found a couple cases on Amazon for the Plus that are thin enough to allow it to work.  Overall the current series is simply still worth it just for the price.  They go on sale several times a year and get really cheap on Amazon Prime Day, making it an even better deal if you wait for those sales.  I'm not a proponent of paying for extended warranties, but I did have a speaker die on my last one.  These are not the highest quality components, so you might still consider extending, especially if you are buying one for children.",,

Husband got it for me as an early Christmas present, and I love it! Since I was able to sync my iPad Kindle app, everything transferred over, and I didn't have to change much. Only thing that's confusing is that with the sync, sorting by Most Recent in the Downloaded tab is from oldest to newest, while the All tab is newest to oldest. Minor, but still annoying. Battery life seems pretty standard -- getting 2-3 days on a charge, using it regularly. It definitely does make my purse lighter!!",,,,

9,,"This is the best deal to get the start of a generic tablet The price can't be beat for the hardware you get.  The tablet has a decent amount of memory, you can add a SD card and the processor is fairly fast.  If you need a general purpose tablet or a kiosk for monitoring home automation, this is a really good deal.The only downside is the tablet is LOADED with bloatware that I will never use.  Taking this tablet out of the Amazon ecosystem takes some knowledge and skills.  So, what do you do?  Use XDA Fire Toolbox.  This will take out all of the bloatware, decide which Amazon apps to keep or delete, allow you to customize the tablet (like every other tablet) and allow you load apps from the Google Play Store.  I'm not going to give you a web link for the XDA Fire Toolbox because Amazon will block this review.  Do a search and you will find it with little effort.I'm using my Fire HD 8 as a kiosk for a Home-Assistant dashboard.

I liked my iPad ok but am not an Apple fan.  Until I got this, I didn't know that this was based on Android OS.  That's a big plus for me.  I love that it easily integrated with my Echo and my Fire stick and now I have another way to control things, plus it can act like an Echo Show.  I love damn near everything about this.Two things I don't like:  Power button placement - too easy to accidentally turn it off. Something recessed would be better.  Night mode pretty much just turns everything yellow.  Yeah you can adjust the tone somewhat, but still haven't found a tone I like.Unless you're a diehard Apple Fanboy or Girl, I would definitely take this for a ride.

I’m pretty ticked as I have read other people having the same problem . .",,,,
3,,"Fair and balanced The price point and features meet expectations.  I seriously considered other options including other makers of tablets but came back to this option in hopes that the tablet would work.  The last Kindle fire I bought had a memory issue which would create all sorts of other issues.  After years of dealing with the last Kindle I was not excited to pick up another kindle.  This new kindle so far has had no issues which is refreshing.  The speed of the kindle is quick unlike my prior one.  I am still not a big fan of the Kindle layout but it gets the job done.  I am not a fan of the Silk browser or the Kindle echo system which is overly controlled, like Apple but with fewer options.  Ask yourself what you need the tablet to do, if you are reading Amazon books, listening to Audible books, shop on Amazon and maybe some light browsing this will work.  If you are thinking that you are going to load Chrome or use it like you use your Cell phone - this probably is not your device.  This device is built on old tech (screen resolution is poor) but for most people it will work fine, this includes me.  I am not excited about these things, but for what I need to do they are fine.",,,
4,"Excellent value in small package. I ordered this device, actually 2 of them, to replace two Fire HDX 7"" units that were on their last legs .  The battery life is definitely better and the screen is excellent, but there are some features that I will miss from the HDX.  The software has obviously changed and some of my previously downloaded apps are no longer available in the cloud.  I had to purchase a new modem/router because the new Fires were not compatible with the ATT router I had.  I spent several hours and days on the phone with Amazon and ATT to configure the new Fires and finally have them working properly.  But what should have been so simple and has always been simple turned into a week long problem.  I realize that technology changes, but this has been more trouble than it should have been.Thankfully, Amazon has been very good in helping me get this resolved.  I have been a Kindle user for many years and if I had not had my HDX for so long I probably would not mind the changes so much.  Love the size and use these for travel all the time.",,,,
5,,"Replacing my tired old 2013 Google Nexus with Fire 8HD+ I purchased the 2020 Fire 8HD+ 64/3GB w/o Ad's on Black Friday for $120. Coming from my old tired 2013 Google Nexus 7, this was def an improvement. I like the Fire Tab although it does have a few cons. Firstly the screen resolution could be a little better, it looks dull to me. I use Pulse SMS on my phone and on the old Nexus with no problems. I can't get Pulse SMS to function on the Fire Tab. Not sure if it's Fires version of Android 9 or if something else I've done to muck it up. I reached out to the Pulse SMS DEV for assistance. For now I'm using Google Voice which works well.Installed XDA's Fire Toolbox so I could freeze some Amazon apps and installed Play Store which is way better than Amazon App Store IMO (Sorry Jeff).While play games in landscape I occasionally and unintentionally bump the power button turning off the tablet. I wish the designers placed these buttons on the side of the Tablet. Also, I installed Adaway and Blokada which both work well keeping those pesky YouTube Ad's under control.It sounds like I'm unhappy with my purchase...

So I replaced my Kindle 2nd gen with the the new Fire HD 8 Plus 10th gen, no advertising, 64Gig. The new Kindle works OK. To be honest the 8 Plus doesn't run any faster than my 2nd gen kindle especially on word lookups. The page turn or scroll by swiping my finger across the screen doesn't work well. Pages get confused while going right to left. Pages get stuck in the middle of turns. My 2nd gen Kindle never did that. The pages suddenly shrink because of a motion my left finger performs. It is annoying. The HD 8 fire is suppose to be 30% faster; I don't see it. I know the fire isn't a top of the line tablet, but Amazon has had ample time to perfect the OS and keep it stable.I use the fire 8 HD Plus to mostly read books. For a 10th generation Kindle Fire, I'm assuming that is what Amazon sent to me, a 2020 model, I'm disappointed in the performance and the quality of the software. I read that the software wasn't great. It seems like Amazon is loosing interest the the Kindle Fire.I like my Kindle 8 Plus, but i liked my 2nd generation fire better. I like the 8"" screen, it is sharp. I don't like the page scroll and the performance is no better or even slightly less than my Kindle 2nd gen. I like the duel speakers over my Fire 2nd gen speaker.

0,"Better and worse than my 2016 Kindle Fire HD 8 I ordered the Fire HD 8 Wireless without Ads. I called tech service twice because I get ads persistently. They do not show up on the opening screen, which I guess satisfies Amazon's sense of ""no ads"". However, they show up when using apps, and are aggravating, something I did not experience on those same apps with my 2016 model. It is easier to find my library items (e.g., genres in Audible and podcasts, read vs reading, etc.), which is a plus. The touch screen is erratic - sometimes too touchy and other times I have to press harder. The transfer to the new Fire 8 was seamless, the sound is good, the wireless cradle works perfectly, and the cover is better than I expected since they dropped the leather. I know I will use this device as much as the old one - I just wish I didn't have to put up with the ads. If you pay the extra for the ad-free feature, be aware your experience won't be entirely ad-free. (Customer service was civil.)",,,,

I got the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet to get the ""top of the line"" version so I wouldn't have any problems watching Prime Videos or Youtube videos etc.  I can of course access my Amazon account to look at products & make purchases.  The screen on the Fire HD 8 Plus looks great.  BIG problem though.  For no reason at all, the screen just SHUTS OFF.  This can be right in the middle of watching a show on Amazon Prime or even watching a You Tube video.  And this happens often.At first I thought maybe I accidentally hit the ""on-off"" button on the side of the tablet.  But sometimes I'm not even touching it, I have it leaning against a book or something & I'm watching a show & the screen just SHUTS OFF by itself.  I've tried doing a power shut down (to try to re-set my Kindle) & turned off the device.  I confirmed my Wi-Fi connection is either Very Good or Excellent at the time.  So I have to go through the process of turning the Fire tablet back on & log on again.  Annoying!  Now I understand it's not the end of the world, but it is frustrating & inconvenient.This ""problem"" occurs often enough that You Tube videos have been produced  addressing this very problem, which indicates that it's NOT just my particular device.I've  watched these You Tube videos addressing various options you can try to fix this problem.  Nothing has worked.  I purchased this product in mid January 2021.  Of course the 90 day warranty is over.  The problem started occurring about 4 months after my purchase.  So basically I cannot send it back to Amazon.  I can't tell you how FRUSTRATING it is to have this Kindle Fire just SHUT OFF for no reason when you're in the middle of watching something.The new Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus is good, WHEN IT'S WORKING.  NOT GOOD when it just shuts off!You might consider waiting for the NEXT generation to come out & hopefully they will have resolved this problem.  It's ashamed.  I would have LOVED this product if it didn't have this shutting off for no reason problem.Now it is possible that I just got a LEMON, so maybe other customers are not having this issue.  My last two Kindles never had this issue.  It would be great if Amazon would REPLACE this product considering that this is a product DEFECT, but I'm not holding my breath."

Dumping News Stand magazines into my books is also annoying, as I seldom combine those activities.  Also dislike that the READ banner is auto inserted.

The upgrade process was really great. Basically, I charged it up and logged into my Amazon account and clicked to let it do the upgrade.

Gaming and listening to Audible books as simultaneously.  I bought the extra storage and paid $25 to remove the ads.  Pluses are: It is the best gaming tablet for the money, at least from my fairly extensive research it is.  Overall, it's a good little tablet.  If you love Amazon then you won't mind the extras.  Graphics are great and the extra ram is great for gaming.  Minuses: the browser is below average, and to date I have not been able to download Google, hopefully I'm wrong.  Even with paying for ad free there are at least ten icons on the home screen that you can't delete, most lead straight to Amazon, which happens at any opportunity.  My biggest complaint is that the volume is only loud enough if you are playing a game, if I am listening to Audible at night and put on a game the volume blasts up when I'm trying to be quiet.  Audible is owned by Amazon, even the app on here is outdated.  In conclusion, I use it for gaming only.",,,

Get a screen protector and a good case, then get a protection plan just in case, you never know where, or what your little one is going to do with it. The tablet has really been a fantastic tool for my child for means of motor skills and learning as he is autistic. He has become more proficient than ever with computers and tablet technology through the use of his tablet time with Fire kids edition software. I definitely recommend this to any parent as you can easily control content. The newest edition, well the 8 HD plus is my favorite by far out of all of them as its the fastest, even more so than the 10! Better RAM, better storage options, screen quality, battery life, and expandable memory. Definitely worth it... I also wanted to add that I love the wireless charger, my little one can now put his own device on the charger without breaking it as plugging in a regular plug was a bit hard for him. He would get frustrated so I didn't want to chance it breaking, love the technology! Lots of apps too! Yay.",,,

The response time as one moves from app to app is good; so is loading time if searching something on the web.Touchscreen does what I ask.Although I often keep it in airplane mode when not using it, I've found that not doing so barely drains the battery any faster when it is sitting idle.Camera, front and back, are decent, not good or great; but that's why one might pay good money for a phone; this is not a phone.I've mostly used it for the kindle books and audible.  I like that my entire library is shown for each and easily browsed, loaded, and opened/played.Visuals are not excellent or superbly sharp but very good, nonetheless; I'm happy with them.There are some good options for apps the Amazon play store, but I followed the online directions to load the Google Play and give myself the full suite of options.Although I haven't tested it yet, nor had it long enough to judge on how it wears over time, I would guess that the screen offers over 16 hours of use reading or playing video before it is depleted to 0.

2,,"My all in one tablet I bought one for my son last Christmas and was impressed with how the Tablet ran and the battery life. I had a Fire way back in the 2nd generation and it was pretty difficult to use since many apps were not available. I have seen a MASSIVE change in battery life and in the way the apps work on the tablet. I use it for everything now when it comes to downloading movies or shows for travel, to using apps like Netflix and Paramount +. Thus far I am very impressed at the cost and what it does with battery life and time to charge. Works very well and no issues with the screen quality",,,
3,,,"Good for reading and that's about it The first thing I noticed after setup is how -slow- the navigating is compared to my regular tablet. I added 256G memory and, there's far less apps, so I am very disappointed, especially since the RAM is promoted as a mjor feature... SURPRISE, it doesn't seem to make a difference.If the Kindle app on my table and phone had the text-to-speech feature for books, I wouldn't have even bought a Kindle device. I'm a student and my life outside of school is filled to the brim with work, family, and running a business. Having the books read to me while I am working would be a great way to keep up with my required reading for class. However, I'm not sure it's worth having an additional device for just that feature with it being so ""draggy."" I will give it a few days and update this review if there is an improvement. Otherwise, it's going back to Amazon next week.The screen clarity is great. I tested the sound by downloading my favorite Amazon playlist... I am pleasantly surprised at how sharp my music sounds on the kindle. I also downloaded a few of the movies I have purchased on amazon and they also look and sound great.Lastly, the battery life that they promote is not so great at all. If I am reading (without text-to-speech) the battery life is good, but still nothing like the previous generation Kindles. If I am using the music app or watching a video, the battery life drains super fast. For example, my kindle was fully charged an hour ago. After listening to music for about 20 minutes, I'm down to 73%.",,
4,,"Really good Tablet for the money I purchased the Add Free Fire HD 8plus 64gig about 3 months ago with the case and so far this thing is great for the money and very sturdy. My 5 year old son and 8 year old daughter use it all the time for You Tube and Minecraft. It works great with no lag. I am no computer person, but I easily was able to add the four extension apps that allowed you to put the Playstore on it so that was great. I also purchased a 128gig Memory Card for $20 so between the 64 gig internal and that we should be square for some time. This thing has already been dropped several times by my two kids on our ceramic tile floors and with that case so far no cracks on the screen. The charge lasts all day and finally with a USB-C charger cable! It also charges wirelessly thru the case on my fancy Desk lamp charger so that’s really cool. I would say that my only complaint is what other reviewers mentioned in that this screen really gets dirty easily. Even when my children dont use it it really seems to get filthy more so than my Samsung tablet does, but I can totally live with that for the money.",,,

Any download now turns into a kindle document with no way to print it. So I have to print a different way. This is a game changer for a VERY loyal customer! Too bad, Amazon.",,,,
6,,"What a fun ""touchless"" Amazon tablet for content consumption! It's worth noting the BIGGEST reason that I purchased this charming little Amazon fire HD 8 plus is to enjoy the built in hands free Alexa voice command in what I considered to be an untethered Echo Show.I can get almost everything I want done with quick voice commands on this practically touchless portable device. I find myself using this device more than I do my touch screen intensive high-end Android smart phone & Surface Pro tablet.If the voice driven Alexa Smart Assistant was not included on this low end tablet, I would have not purchased it. I do NOT intend on putting an unscrupulous version of the Google play store on this tablet.If I wanted a new Android tablet they are available for as low as $25 these days with the newest most safe upgradable Google play store version pre-installed on it, not an old spyware riddled Google play store APK from an anonymous Internet source?Aside from the minimal CPU processor speed and meager speaker sound quality, my only gripe is that I can not use ""Computer"" as the Alexa wake word.

I find I prefer reading on a tablet to on a computer or my phone, and the older tablet (from 2013, I think) was finally dying and wouldn't hold a charge any more.This tablet is great for exactly what I want to use it for - I read, watch videos, listen to audiobooks or Amazon Music.  The small form factor makes it nice and easy to slip in to a bag to take with me, and the battery life lasts days - I typically don't bother to recharge it until Friday, just so I have a full battery for the weekend.  I also bought the wireless charging stand, and it tops the tablet up in almost no time.  I'm not using it in the Echo Show mode as often yet - I have the charging station at my desk, and don't want to enable Show Mode while I'm working.  I might move the charger to the kitchen to be able to take advantage of that mode a little more.If you're looking for something to create content with instead of consuming content, you're probably looking for something a little larger and with some sort of pen-device support.

9,,,"Decent and affordable tablet for Amazon Prime Members, poor product description TL:DR: 3.5 stars. There are better tablets out there, but for the money, most Amazon Prime Members might find it a convenient device, that's if they don't mind that some of their streaming video content freezing every couple of minutes and like that the loaded software takes up a lot of internal storage space. I probably won't recommend it to others or buy it again.Pros:- Great value for Amazon Prime Video, Kindle, Prime Shopping, etc.- Screen quality is good in low to no-light condition- Hardware build and design is great overall- No shortage of cases- Battery life is very good- Bluetooth works wellCons:- Product description failed to say the one I purchased comes with advertisements- Android OS is not that stable. Certain programs keep running in the background even after force stopping it- Pre-installed apps and software takes up hard drive space by quite a significant amount, so you don't get the actual advertised storage space- Some Prime Video content freezes and/or mutes. I tried the same content on two different devices and the Fire Tablet is the only device that has video freezing issues.- Kindle launches on it's own sometimes and runs in the background using up battery and other resources- Limited to what apps you can find and install- Too many ads*Haven't used camera yet.Update Feb 12, 2021: Some video content still freezes every couple of minutes to the point where it's unwatchable. You have to download it to watch it interrupted, but some free content on IMDB TV also freezes and you can't download those.

1,Big improvement over my 6th gen HD The HD 8 Plus is MUCH quicker than my old 6th generation Fire HD 8. I'm very happy with it.,,,,
2,,,"Kind of a let down I've had this tablet for about 2 weeks now, and I have to say that I am less than impressed.  It's something of a let down in comparison to my previous tablet.  You see, my prior tablet was a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 4th gen.  The HDX was a much better tablet, and why you stopped making it, I really don't know.  The HDX was a 2013 release, so 7 years ago it was a better tablet than the 8 plus is now.  It had an 8 mega pixel rear camera; compare that to the 8 plus' 2mp.  Both were 64gb with 12 hour batteries, but the resolution of the HDX was  2560x1600, a vastly different viewing experience from the 8 plus' 1280x800 and far better even than the 10's 1920x1200, which my husband owns and I find bulky and heavy.  The 8 plus and HDX are 12.5 and 13 ounces respectively, but the HDX, even 7 years ago had a faster processer, 2.5 ghz to the 8+ 2.0ghz and a larger screen and slimmer body for that .5 ounce.  I would gladly pay more for another HDX, but it seems that Amazon is no longer about making solid, middle of the road tablets but trying to corner the market on cheap tablets you want to trade in every year or two.  Add to that that I keep getting an annoying orange box around my games and books that freezes up the screen, and I honestly can't say for sure whether I want to keep this or not.  If I do, it will be because it was a black Friday special and is suitable until I find a replacement, not because I truly like it.",,
3,,,"Room For Improvement I bought my Fire 8 Plus to be a super Kindle basically. And there is certainly room for Amazon to get over itself and make the product more useable to long time customers. You do not force customers to ONLY use your stuff by limiting their choices to ONLY your items. What you are doing is making feel more like just dumping Amazon all together. And that day will come, how soon, depends on how arrogant Amazon.com continues to be.The app store SUCKS! It is difficult to find apps that you are looking for or that meet the needs that you want. For example, I want a generic eReader to add for my books that are NOT mobi and NO I do not want to ask Amazon permission and approval to read books by jumping through hoops to have Amazon convert non mobi ebooks to mobi. I want an app that just lets me read my books my way! Conversion does not always respect the integrity of the original publication.The screen has 1/3 wasted by some pop up AD, even though I paid for the NOT ad supported version...the argument, I am sure would be that it is not an actual AD it is some feature notification....point is, I DO NOT WANT IT ON MY SCREEN and can't seem to make it go away....so the bottom row or two of the apps that I do want are hidden!The hardware of the Fire 8 Plus seems to be satisfactory.....it has only been a couple weeks so ..... while I do like it, it will probably be the ""Kindle"" device and the ONLY Fire device that I ever buy.",,

5,,"A highly useful tablet It suffers like all Fire tablets from an inadequate Amazon App Store — though you can find a workaround — and is not a speed demon. Yet it is a solid performer.Build quality is good, the design is a utilitarian but rather stylish upgrade, it’s pleasant to hold in the hand, and it is quite sturdy. Much more so than my beloved iPad Mini, which of course is better but also costs far more. That’s why I carry this rather than the iPad when I’m out and about.Watching movies, TV shows and news on this is quite pleasant. The screen is no Liquid Retina, but it is bright and clear. They’ve improved it from the earlier Fire HD 8 without upping the formal resolution.Speakers are better, too. Spotify plays quite well on it.E-mail and web browsing are very smooth as well.It’s a very nice machine, which I was especially thrilled to get half off.",,,
6,,,"Not recommended First, there are some apps that are not available to install or download. Second, after 18 months of purchase and use, the device has to be rebooted for at least 3 times. The screen is a bit darker when you see it from a different angle. This might not be a problem if you will only use the device for yourself.  But in my case, I like watching movies together with my child in the car but it is hard to see the screen in the original lighting unless I lean towards the center of the device. The brightness, which is necessary when using the device outside, is lower than Samsung tablets. The sound is better though. The good things about this device are the storage and faster speed than some Samsung devices within the same price range.",,
7,,"Definitely evolving! This is Kindle #3 for me so yes I am a confirmed fan! #2 died appox. a month ago, so when someone special was looking for the ideal gift for me he hit the nail on the head. While being approximately the same size the cases say otherwise. Each kindle has gotten lighter and more energy-efficient despite having a few more bells and whistles (still looking to locate an app that whistles just for fun). While I was hoping the power cord would be the same as the previous but then I would end up using it for everything else too but then I can not use the car charger for cell phone to charge my kindle either not sure if this is a good trade-off or not. Access to the various buttons has switched up have to admit they do make sense.",,,
8,,,"Changeable This model has actually lasted a year and a half, longer than previous Kindle models. That's the good news. The bad news is that Amazon controls your device. Overnight, the main screen display changes, with no warning, explanation or your being able to change it. Sometimes it shows the books you're reading, sometimes it shows books they think you should buy. Functions are discontinued, without warning. (Also, Amazon, I do not think the word ""deprecated"", as relating to the Docs app suddenly becoming hidden, means what you think it means!)The device is adequate for the price, although it's certainly irritating that it always goes on sale AFTER I buy one, and I like the optional, costs extra, wireless charger, because it's usually the charging port that breaks; but there are enough annoying little things that I felt motivated to write this review over a year after I bought the item.",,

I got a non-glare screen protecter and it makes reading very much easier.  Looks cooler as well.  I highly recommend that fabric cover that can turn into a stand.  You can stand it up horizontally 'and' vertically.  Great for reading and not having to hold it.  Nice unit.",,,
0,,,"For me, this only words as an offline tablet. ProsEverything associated with the kindle app on this is a big improvement over the kindle app on my old samsung.  Fast, high performance.  No errors or crashes.  Crisp display.  Easier on the eyes.The Night Shade feature cuts blues from the screen at a set time of day to avoid disruption to sleep.  I love this.I can move files onto it with ease through my USB cable.  That beats apple.  However...Cons...accessing those files has proven a challenge.  Root cause?  The native apps aren't very good.  The photos app has limited zoom, which makes my high res maps and infographics useless.  It also sorts my files by date or other arbitrary attributes and ignores my neat folder and file structure.  As for the video app, I can't even figure out how to watch the few movies I loaded into the memory.  Which brings me to my next gripe.The focus of many of the native apps is to push amazon content.  I got the ad free fire.  Where in the world would they put the ads if I hadn't?  When it's online, it has wall to wall promotions already!As I said, the native apps are effectively useless bloatware.  I never imagined a new gallery app and file explorer app would be necessary just to gain basic functionality.Lastly, said native apps can't be deleted.  I can dump most trashy apps that I don't like on a new apple or samsung.  I guess being stuck with amazon's content and content pushing is why the kindle fire is priced so low.",,
1,Hung up & wouldn't recharge I love the screen and all but once the initial charge started going down I put it on the charger-came back & it still showed 16% so I left it until the next day and still showed 16%-went to the help section & was told to power it down with the button and after that it started charging-this was the first time to recharge since I bought it so this is pretty ominous......,,,,

It was an impulse buy. Now that I have it, I have to say ""so what?"" There's nothing wrong with it but I can see that my need for the tablet remains pretty much the same as my Amazon Fire 7 5th Gen from 2015: reading a book or PDF, playing some music via Bluetooth headphones, browsing through my Google Drive. That's about it. If you go from a 7"" screen to a 10.1"" screen to FHD, then you're talking. I'm probably going to return it and simply buy a replacement battery for my Fire 7. It still works fine and does everything I need it to. I find the 8"" HD Plus a bit unwieldy. The 2015 Fire 7"" is less so.",,
4,,"Nice upgrades I upgraded to a 10th generation Kindle Fire from a 7th generation that I'd had for two years. So far I've been pleased with the improved battery life and the nimbler processing speed. I'm also delighted that the charging port is now USB-C, which is more compatible with my phone and laptop, as well as just plain easier to use (no more multiple attempts to plug in the charger!).My biggest complaint is with the placement of the camera/light sensor, now centered on the left side of the device, rather than centered at the top of the device. This location makes sense if one is using the Kindle as some sort of docked household device, but not if using it to read books and holding it with the left hand (as most right-handed folks--probably 90% of users--are wont to do). It's irritating to have the light level of the screen suddenly change because I've occluded this area of the device after slightly shifting the position of my hand.Still, overall I'm more pleased with this upgrade than with my last upgrade.",,,
5,,"Love my HD8+ I have had both a Fire HD8 and a Paperwhite for a couple of years - they each serve different purposes for me.  I had used the Paperwhite for reading books, and the HD8 when I needed to run apps and direct lighting wasn't a problem.  One thing that always bothered me (a little) was the slow opening of the apps that I used.  When the HD8+ came out with its faster processor and more memory, I thought it might be the answer to performance.  It was!  The additional cost was more than made up with the performance boost, and the cost wasn't really all that much as I was able to trade my older HD8 in.  I'm very pleased with my purchase, and would clearly do it again.",,,
6,,,"Charging Problems... My new Fire HD 8 Plus Tablet doesn't consistently charge. I bought it on Black Friday, along with the Wireless Charging Dock. Since the tablet came charged I began using it right away. After a few weeks, when the charged dropped to 32%, I left it on the charging dock overnight (all connections checked). Next day it was still at 32%, so I reseated it on the dock and left it eight more hours. It stayed at 32%.Then I switched to the cable and adapter. A few hours later the tablet was at 100%. I assumed the problem had been with the Charging Dock so I returned it. But the next time I tried to charge the tablet (at 15%) with cable and adapter, it was still 15% after 12 hours. So I moved the adapter to another outlet on my surge protector and it charged to 81% in about 4 hours. However, I tested the outlets on my surge protector and every one worked.I didn't experience this with my older HD8 and HD10 tablets.

Also as will almost all fire tablets  the power port is on the top. This dose not make it a good candidate  for reading in bed. It also dose not take well to a pop up shower, thanks to the power port being on the top.  The best advantage  to this fire tablet is that it supports  wireless  charging. Good news battery  life is improved  over the last few editions.  Have yet to see how it handles  airline in-flight entertainment  system.  Another thing i noticed that is poor layout of the rear and front  facing  cameras.  But the front camera move is for the show capabilities once again the camera is light on pixels density capability. But this only is noticeable  in low light issue.

I just want the tablet to work as I want it to work. I have the 7th gen and use it almost all the time. I know it will die at some point so I bought the 10th gen when I traded in a newer Fire (9th gen, I think). I am using the 7th gen with the charging dock and  the only issue I have is that the charging docks are specific to which device you have. I do not use them for anything except charging and they work great for that. I do not like that everything is going to the C usb because we all have so many other cords. I am not so lazy that I cannot turn a usb over to plug it in. Progress....$%^&(&^%$",,,,

It makes for a much better user experience, especially when using the Silk Browser.Having 64G for internal storage also improves the speed a bit. On my previous device, compatible apps were moved to the flash drive which make them slightly slower to load.There are subtle changes in the GUI that are welcome, specifically the CLEAR ALL option to close all open apps at once. As I re-downloaded apps I was using on my 7th generation Fire 8 and Fire 10, a couple were not available for the Plus. Both were news apps.A pet peeve with Fire tablets is slight changes in dimensions that require a new case when you upgrade. The Plus design moved the camera to the side, shortening the length. It makes much more sense for using it in Show Mode. The result is a more compact device, justifying the need for a new case. Personally, it feels better in my hand.As a longtime fan of Fire tablets, the Plus is a nice upgrade for me.",,,

Why isn't the Fire HD 8+ ABI arm64-v8a (64-bit)?The Fire HD 8+ has a 64-bit CPU, but has an Application Binary Interface (ABI) of armeabi-v7a, which means the tablet is limited to running only 32-bit applications. This issue is affecting millions of Amazon customers that purchased the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet. In 2022, many current and emerging mobile apps in development are designed for 64-bit mobile devices, and will not install/run on 32-bit devices. Why wasn't the Fire HD 8+ compiled with an ABI of arm64-v8a, which would have enabled the tablet to run both 64-bit and 32-bit applications?Why was the tablet limited in what applications it could run, when the hardware supports 64-bit? Can Amazon release an ABI update to enable the Fire HD 8 Plus tablet to run 64-bit applications (as well as legacy 32-bit applications)?

I bought this new Fire HD 8 PLUS, (64g, no ads)  tablet because my Fire 7, which I had for a few years, stopped holding charge.I received this item and was disappointed, it is smaller than my previous Fire 7.  I expected it to be bigger (8"" and all)  Set up was smooth and the case is lovely. I haven't really gotten into it yet.  What I have seen so far is that its sluggish, not faster at all, takes a few extra seconds for an app to open and the page to load and I haven't even installed anything extra in it yet.It came at 71% charge and I left it for a few days before trying to charge it. The provided USB-C charging cable and plug did not work. I tried it in several wall sockets, leaving it plugged in at one time for 3 hours with no charge at all (it was 48% when I plugged it in). I decided to try it with a universal USB-C charger instead and only then it charged fully.Other than that, its a neat and not bulky or heavy.  I hope in time I can come to love it as I did my previous Fire 7.",,
0,"Definitely faster, but the case dimensions are different. I had a 6th generation Fire HD 8, and liked pretty much everything except it's speed -- turtle-like for me.  So I've been waiting for Amazon to upgrade the tablet.  They certainly succeeded in most respects, especially improving the performance.  From what scant information I could find on the 'net, it was supposed to be identical on the outside, just improved inside.  But the exterior dimensions have changed.  It is shorter in height, but wider.  It no longer fits easily in my hand.  That's a bummer.  I thought previously about buying another tablet, but thought I'd stick with Amazon. In addition, the position of the buttons have changed.  So my previous case doesn't fit due to dimensions and button locations.  I also had an issue with the screen colors being ""washed out"" compared to my old Fire.  But a ""factory reset"" restored the display to being just as good. (Not a great display compared to most phones, but decent.)  What else is better? As best I can tell in my house, the wifi performance has improved.  All-in-all, a good tablet at a low price.",,,,
1,,,Great until it wasn’t.. It worked fine until around 8.5 months of having it. No damage and always in a case but it randomly just stopped working. It gets stuck in this screen. I tried to get it replaced but it’s out of warranty. Not happy with it.,,
2,,"Kindle Fire HD 8 is the Fire's last chance! So far so good after one week.  I previously had two older Fire tablets and there was some issue with the charging cords.  The connection to charge would not be made, in one case after six month, and in the second nine.  Amazon replaced the former.  I did not bother asking about the latter.  This one recharges super fast and so far is performing very well, but if I have chsrging issues with this one I will return it for what credit I can get and go back to my Paper White Kindle reader.  I would strongly suggest paying the $37 or so dollars for the wireless charging station, which also charges the unit very quickly and will save wear and tear on the charging port.  Side note: the shape of the male connector that goes into the female charging port is nit the same as on older models, so if you pass on the charging stand, you may want to spebd the money on one or two extra cords.  But, so far, I am pleased.  But this is the last Fire I plan on buying, and if I have charging problems, I will be done unless it begins in a few years.",,,
3,,"Big Improvement over my  previous Kindle Fire I'd become resigned to replacing my Kindle Fire every 12-14 months and the charger cords every three or four months. It seems (fingers crossed) that the charging problem has been addressed with this model. When you insert the charger into the slot, there's now an audible click. No more wiggling the cord to get it at just the right angle to charge. My new tablet is not old enough yet to know if it will continue to perform at this level, but so far so good. There are only two issues I'm running into so far. First, sometimes I have to touch it 5 or 6 times before it registers, but I'm willing to consider that it's my hands, not a performance issue. Also, the tech world's mysterious bias against those of us who are left-handed is an on-going issue. Second, that aggravating ""Dashboard"" button is right where a left thumb lands when holding it. I spend as much time closing the Dashboard as I do activating the functions I want. Too bad you can't move things around like you can with a computer desktop.",,,
4,"Don't Expect A Lot If you have modest expectations, this is a satisfactory tablet.  It's cheap and does the job if you limit yourself to basic tasks like light internet browsing, listening to Pandora, reading books & emails.  Anything else and you hit its limitations quickly.  The screen can appear washed out off angle and many graphics laden internet pages load slowly.  Also, the Amazon Store's choices are very limited, nothing like the Apple Store, so buyer beware.  All in all a good buy if you wait for a sale.",,,,

Received as a Christmas gift & am enjoying enhanced features for Alexa, on-demand streaming, Zoom etc.  I already had a Fire 7 for several years which I used constantly for Kindle reading.  So, I appreciated the easy set-up of the new Fire 8HD Plus along with its enhanced features and the automatic transfer of my former library content. Tablet speed is much faster than my old unit, screen quality is crisp, battery life more than adequate (but I use the auto charge docking station most days.) I have not activated the email set-up because it demands permission to access all mail, as well as allowing changes or deletions of that content from my Gmail account. I feel that should NOT be a requirement---so won't be activating that feature.  Other than that, I am extremely happy with the Fire 8HD plus.  I do recommend the automatic docking/charging station available for this version.  I keep it set-up in my kitchen and use it most days.

The processing speed, screen quality, & battery life remind me of my very old mini iPad 2 - at a fraction of the price. I am more than pleased w/this device. I like the Fire over an iPad because of the price & because of text to speech. I hardly ever *read* a book anymore. For me it's either Audible or text to speech, & I appreciate the fact I have the choice of different reading voices on this device which were not available on the 7"".

But, as time went on, I found myself using it almost entirely for reading Kindle ebooks - and it was awfully big, heavy, and awkward just for reading ebooks.  I picked up this Kindle Fire HD 8+ as a replacement for that Pixel C, primarily for reading ebooks.I can't say I'm a fan of the home screen and heavy-handed Amazon interface.  It's a little weird and awkward.  I prefer the simple, straight-forward Android interface.But I absolutely cannot argue with the performance or price.  It's a cheap, lightweight Android-based tablet that does a fantastic job of displaying my Kindle ebooks.  I've also played some music and watched some movies from both Netflix and Amazon Prime - all of which have worked great.  I really have no complaints about the functionality.I'm also liking the wireless charging.  It's nice not to have to fiddle with cables - just drop it on the charger at the end of the day.",,,,

It downloads books quickly, theyre easy to find and read, so the most important feature is great. It doesnt always show when you have completed a book which is odd, but not a problem. It doesn't save your exact page, but its usually only a page off when you go back into the book. The only complaint I have currently is that the Amazon video is useless. I can not even watch an entire episode of even the shortest shows before the screen is frozen but the sound continues. I am rather disappointed about this as it is an Amazon tablet so one would hope it would work with Amazon apps. This tablet was to replace a regular tablet and update an original Kindle fire. My original Kindle fire can play Netflix, and its about 8 years old, so i am disappointed in that. Feels like the fire took a step backwards rather than forward.",,,,
7,,"Thanks goodness Amazon FINALLY added wireless charging to the Plus model I never liked my little kids trying to plug in a micro USB cable every night. So I had rigged a Qi coil conversion kit you hide under a tablet case. But when a wireless charger was not available (ie, road trips) the wife or kids would eventually break the kit's delicate USB ribbon cable trying to take it out. No more! This new Fire generation has optional integrated coils. And there must be several coils because kids can poorly position the tablet and all my Qi chargers still detect and charge!Don't cheap out on the low end. The extra $20 also gets you 3 Gb of RAM which seemed to be a lagging problem with only 2Gb on our older models. I don't think the extra 32GB of storage is worth it since that +$30 can get you a 256GB SD card. BUT one annoying problem - If you have a FreeTime for Kids subscription, Amazon *still* won't allow any apps like Disney, etc. to see that SD card to download movies. So on the road they have to get the parent's PIN code for the main non-kid-friendly mode. And then we have to change the PIN once home. Shame.",,,
8,,,,"* * Why Even Buy HD8+ or other FIRE Device ??? * * What a DISAPPOINTMENT : (We are not at all impressed with HD8+ 64 GB:- Feels CHEAPLY BUILT & responds the same.- Tons of ADS + BLOATWARE  (paid AMAZON extra for HD8+ to have the ads REMOVED - still get the same ads.  They are crammed in most every page you see instead of just lock screen. : (We bought used a 7HD GENERATION 4 on eBay for only $10.00 a few months  earlier.  It is really impressive & very well built!!!  7HD had no slot for adding SD Card to expand memory / storage.7"" is nice size.  8HD+ is very slick, a bit to big - making clumbsy & hard to hold in a hand.  10"" you usually need a stand & keyboard or use on your lap.I hoped the extra processing capacity of the 8HD+ 64GB would make it possible to retire the 7HD as battery is going bad.  Instead, now the 8HD+ rarely gets used.  7HD gets used for hours everyday.The concept of Fire was good at the time. Yet, Fire is very limited for apps & abilities... Actually Fire operating systems I've taken a close look at are just an obomination of a quite outdated ANDROID os.Although possible, with considerable time, effort, frustration & watching YouTube, it is possible to acquire most Android apps to utilize on most Fire devices in a roundabout way.It just makes more sense to buy an ANDROID tablet (or phone) then easily install from Google Play Store, Amazon's App Store,  Apptoid, or many other alternative stores for apps.  Thus, you can avoid much of the BLOATWARE by installing the apps for only the things you wish to utilize on AMAZON ~ PRIME is AWESOME!  Plus you can EASILY install & FULLY utilize ALL Android apps available for your Android Device.After some looking, I got a generic unbranded 10"" tablet with512 GB with WiFi, Dual SIM allows for Cellular Data & Phone service, hotspot, Micro SD Card slot { I added 1Tb }, Deca-core 2.2 Ghz processor running Android 10 for only $75.00 NEW with free shipping.  BASICALLY, resulting in a over all easier to run & incredibly fast tablet with nearly 10 times the GB of internal storage & so very many more abilities than 8HD+ 64GB... Best of all... At about 1/2 the cost of Amazon's 8HD+ 64 GB!Both are built similar.I suggest as necessary additional items to also buy when ordering a tablet or phone is a good Tempered Glass to help protect the display screen also a MATTE finish (Glossy is too slippery) TPU, GEL -or- SILICONE bumper or case - as inevitably it will get dropped & knocked around.  A wireless (Bluetooth) keyboard (with mouse) will save much time & make life much easier.Personally, I would NOT consider  Amazon's 8HD PLUS or other new Fire devices as the quality we come to rely on over the years from Amazon just seems to no longer exist.* * Why Even Buy HD8+ or other FIRE Device ??? * *",

1,,,,,"Wish I had stayed with the 8 I have had a Kindle Fire 8 for years and really enjoyed it.  I thought I would treat myself to an upgrade.  It has not been a treat.  The first one sent when I bought it on Prime Day had a problem with the screen. that caused lines all. over it. and shadows on the letters.  I did. not make it through set up before I contacted customer service.  After making me turn it on and off several times, which I had already tried, they agreed it was not working correctly and sent a replacement.  However, they could not send it to the address the original one was shipped to--it could only be sent to my home address.  I was not home and wouldn't be for another week...  I wanted it for my trip because my. old one would not charge anymore.  I arrived home and the. replacement was waiting for me but. I lost. a week. of. my return time. since I. wasn't. home when it. was sent.  This. one seems ok with the screen except the. touchscreen. doesn't to. work. as well as. I. think it. should.  I have had to turn it. on and. off once already because it. was not. responding.  That. fixed. it for now but for. what I paid even on sale--I should not have to do that.  Also, it makes random beeps that I can't figure out.  I have turned off everything I can find in. the settings that would make noise and it has not helped at all.  It even does it when the case is closed and it is. sitting. on my bedside table.  That is not conducive to sleeping which is a problem.  I shouldn't have to take it in the other room so I don't have to listen to it.  So... it's past the return time because these are not problems that are immediately obvious.  I assumed it was fine since the screen looked ok and that I just needed to learn the new system.  That wasn't the case.  I don't think this works as well as my old one did and would be seriously surprised if anyone in my family upgraded again.  Very disappointed."

And I installed Firefox mobile with an adblocker extension. The stock email on the tablet is pretty bare bones, but it's solid and snappy. With all that, the table is fantastic. Webpages load quickly, and the 3gb of RAM means that it seldom has to reload anything. I can keep 15+ tabs open on the browser with no problem. I really only use it for email, websites, RSS feeds, the Washington Post, and ebook reading. For those things, it's perfect.I also love the 8"" form factor for reading. Very comfortable to hold.

2,,,,,"Do NOT buy this for Zoom meetings I have had KIndles for years and loved the first two I had. The really old models. In 2018, when my last one finally died I had to buy another and I didn't like the new one for a long time. I finally just got used to it and it was ok. It was still perfectly fine when I turned it in a few days ago.I upgraded to this one for two reasons. 1. this was the first time the Kindle I had was eligible for the trade-in offers. 2. It showed that you could use it for Zoom meetings.With the Pandemic, it feels like I am always in a Zoom meeting. I thought being lightweight and portable would be a great alternative to my aging laptop. My laptop has a very short battery life especially when using the camera during the whole meeting and so must be kept plugged in for them making going outside on my deck during the hot weather not feasible.Well, forget using this Kindle for zoom meetings. (or anything else involving audio but I'll get to that in a minute). Even in gallery view you only get to see 4 people on the screen so you have to keep swiping to see everyone. Not very useful. Outside, I couldn't seem to get it bright enough to use. And the volume is SO low even turned all the way up, I couldn't hear well enough to use it. It is lacking the controls that Zoom gives me on my laptop and no option to use a virtual background.I tried watching a show from the Hulu app on it and the volume just wasn't enough to be easily heard over the sounds from outside an open window or a fan. The volume is about the same as on my last Kindle and that one was so bad that I couldn't use it for audiobooks or movies or anything with sound unless I used headphones. This one doesn't even have a headphone jack so the ONLY thing this one is good for is reading books!This was an impulse buy and a  waste of money. If I hadn't already sent back my old perfectly good Kindle, I would have returned it.The other thing they did with this one is make it just a teeny tiny bit wider and shorter so that my $30 case won't fit it and I will have to spend another $30 (price has remained the same) for another cover.I am very disappointed in this Kindle."

Nope. Lots of lag when doing basic things like opening up a book or a video on Prime.

2,"Kind of disappointed I'm  wishing that the HDX was still supported, I'm slightly disappointed in. The 8+ is smaller and the cover are bulky. My biggest thing with it is read and unread books.  A lot of the books I've  read are in my unread file.  I read a lot and want my books separated.  I spent hours yesterday with Amazon tech and he doesn't have a glue.  Going through and changing up to 1900 books from unread to read is very time consuming and half the time they are still in my unread books.  I still use my HDX to read and bought another battery to have replaced so I can use it until it no longer works.  If anyone has any ideas on how to move the books and have them stay there.",,,,
3,,,"Mostly good.  Other things were unacceptable. If all you are doing it reading books and streaming video, this device is not bad.  Nice screen.  Fast boot time.  Good size, without being heavy.But the Amazon app store is woefully short on useful apps.  I get that Google is a competitor.  But making customers use a 3rd party app to get their email is ridiculous.  Not allowing a decent browser and forcing you to use that crap-tastic Silk browser they provide is maddening.  The don't even allow you to use Firefox.  How about a common password manager?  Nope.  There are so many extremely useful apps that can run on this system.  But they won't allow you access because the app that is needed to install them says ""Google Play Store"".  They ignore the fact that the entire platform of their device is Android, which was developed by Google.  I thought I'd be able to make it work.  But I was wrong.And then to top it off, they insist on using a 25 year old format factor for the removable SD card.  FAT32 came out with Windows 95.  Yes... 1995.  You can't even buy an SD card formatted with FAT32 anymore.  It's all exFAT.  So no files over 4gb for you.  Which is very limiting if you want to load you own videos onto the SD card.There were some other technical things that rubber me the wrong way.  But those two things were deal breakers for me.  It was returned.",,
4,,,"As a physical device, it's delightful. It's a very impressive piece of electronics — quick, responsive, nice screen, good connectivity.  But the way it comes configured makes it look like Amazon was more concerned with creating a marketing platform than a truly utilitarian tablet.  I'm sure I'll figure out how to cofigure it so that I'm not always confronted with offers for anything even remotely related to anything I've ever bought or looked at, and I got the version that does not include Special Offers.I say I'm sure I'll figure it out, and that brings up another sore point; the HD 8 Plus DOES NOT include a user's guide.  I had a question specific to using the microSD card, and searching the online and on-device help system for anything about microSD cards in a Fire Tablet brought up only four answers — one about erasing data from a microSD card, one about inerting a SIM card, one about transferring content to a Fire Phone, and one about registering your device and setting up payment methods.When I 'chatted' with support about my microSD question (a question that never was answered), I asked where I could find the User's Guide for the HD 8 Plus.  I was told, ""Sorry as of now Amazon has not come with such offers on HD8 plus.""So, I like the device as a device, and I will figure out how to make it mine; but, after so many years of singing the praises of Amazon, I am sorely disappointed about the company aspect of the Fire HD 8 Plus.  A purchase like this should not become such a project.",,
5,,"Faster, more responsive, wirelessly charging HD Plus 2020 This Fire HD plus was bought in order to replace a badly aging Fire 8 from a few years ago. The children are now a few years older. The simple letter tracing games and pattern matching have been replaced with Roblox. While that tablet quickly ran out of battery, this one lasts much longer and die to its 3Gb memory, can play much more intensive games. I posted an image of the tablet wirelessly charging on a Samsung fast charger. Because the previous tablet only had a micro USB charger, it was only able to be charged by one method. I have now trained the children to place this tablet horizontally with its lock above the light for optimal charging. This way, the USB C charging port will not be worn out by repeated plugging 3-4 times a day. The screen is very nice, and response rate is much better, and start up time to first experience on screen is better. This tablet is a must recommend if you have Alexa in your house, works great with Prime Video, is another Alexa when placed on the wireless charger, and is very sturdy during falls. The children have experienced a few of those.",,,
6,,,"It’s OK It’s not a bad tablet. Great for reading. Ok for video viewing. Expandable storage always a plus and the sound system, while not great, isn’t bad either.Browsing and Apps on the other hand, there are a lot of issues. Games and Apps are effectively limited to the Amazon store (I do know that there is a way to use more apps. But really having to take so many extra steps to do so should not be a thing) and usually are either bigger company things, or ad heavy “shovelware” games. Browsing tends to be sluggish, and never really fit on the tablet so you have to constantly readjust, or worse, not visit that website at all. The deal breaker for me, and an example of bother poor apps and poor browsing, are apps like Discord. An app shouldn’t redirect you to the default browser, and work horribly on said default browser to the point you can’t use it at all.Again, not a bad tablet. But some serious fixes to its browser and a stronger App Library are sorely needed.",,

The apps are functional and I'm glad that they have Microsoft now. I wish that other color options for this specific kindle would have been available, but that's not a huge concern since I have a case on it. Battery life seems good.

7,"***Updated Review*** Great tablet, but please get more compatible PDF apps, Amazon I bought this tablet because I was hoping to use it to read PDFs, but Amazon in its wisdom made the good PDF apps incompatible with the Kindle Fire HD8 plus. So I'm stuck with crappy third-party PDF apps rather than the one I use on my phone. Even the positively ancient Kindle Fire I traded in for this one had Adobe Acrobat. Not this one. There are ways online to make this tablet run Google Play apps, but I should not have to mess with this tablet to get it to do the basic function of opening PDF documents.Terrible job, Amazon.*EDIT:* Since I wrote this review, I've since found that the Kindle app on the tablet handles PDFs, so I can read PDFs on this thing, but I cannot edit them or make notes. Reading PDF documents was mainly what I got this tablet for, so I'm upgrading my review. However, Amazon (if you're listening), please make more and better PDF reader apps available for this tablet like they were for previous generations.",,,,
8,,Nice product I am very happy with the tablet.  I purchased it for a 4yr old.  It keeps a charge for hours.  She uses this for some games.  Pre-k learning.  Some movies and cartoons and most of all to contact her distant grandparents via messenger video.  When she calls me at work I can actually hear her and has good reception quality via the video chat.  Her old outdated tablet was just rediculous to hear her and it kept freezing up.  The tablet performs nicely for our needs which is why I gave it a 5 star.  It also charges quickly.What I don't like about it is that apps are purchased through Amazon store and not google play.  Some of her old games are not available but she has found new ones.  I don't like all the Amazon ads either but it was my choice to purchase it at the lower cost.  I can pay to have them removed or watch the youtube videos.  If I were to purchase another AmazonFire I would definitely pay the extra to get it w/o the adds.,,,
9,,,"Not one of the better tablets out there... Coming from the standpoint of having used iPads for years, you’ll forgive me if my expectations are a bit high.Screen quality is pretty low.  You’re almost forced to have to buy a glass screen protector just to have a decent feeling screen.  The feel of the screen without a protector is along the lines of an OG Droid phone.  It tends to pick up fingerprints easily which makes for distracting viewing on a naturally matte screen.I was surprised that even with the upgraded processor, performance and responsiveness is barely at acceptable levels.  An iPad 2, circa 2011, today is about as responsive.  Depending upon apps open and running, you’ll still get periodic freezes.All the negatives aside, I’ll get into my subjective take;Amazon was likely correct in limiting the tablet to its own ecoverse away from Google and the Google Play store.It’s meant to be a light use tablet.  If it’s relegated to the Amazon ecosystem, it’s perfectly fine as a light entertainment tablet.  A kindle book while listening to Spotify, or looking up a recipe, possibly just setting it down to catch an episode of a show.  Given its price point, it does all that Amazon needs and it’s not terrible at it.  I shudder to think what earlier models were like to use.Given the price point and what I believe Amazon is looking to do, I would say it’s a fair tablet for what it is.  Definitely plenty I wish would be better, but it’s still a cheap entry level tablet.",,
0,Amazing device but no notifications. I used to have a fire 7 and it sucked it was very slow and not so responsive. So I bought a fire 8 plus to replace it and so far I have owned it for a month it's smooth it has great performance it's fast and good battery life it lasts for me around the whole day. The bad part and why it lost the star because for some reason the notifications never worked this applies to all fires because it happened on my fire 7 and this one I tried troubleshooting it trying to enable notifications for apps it never works or it was disabled for some reason if it worked for this problem I would have given it five stars but if you don't care about your notifications by this it's pretty good but if you do care about your notifications consider buying a more expensive tablet.,,,,
1,,,"No exFat support 3.5 stars.  I would have given it 5 stars if it supported large files on the microsd card (exFAT).I upgraded 1 of our 2017 Fire HD 8 tablets to the 2020 HD Plus version.  It is definitely faster.  I like the screen aspect ratio.  I really like the USB-C charging.  More RAM.  Good price.  I personally don't care about the wireless charging.However, the lack of exFat support is very disappointing.  I took the micro sd card out of the old table and put it in the new tablet, but it isn't supported.  Sure, I can reformat it as FAT32, but that cannot hold movies over 4GB.  Booo!",,
2,"Just nice Everything works fine as expected. What I don't like is that I cant get the YouTube in the normal setting.

3,"Does not come with display mirroring I originally had a kindle fire 7 hdx and absolutely loved that tablet.  We had it since 2013 but had to replace it since the battery would not charge or hold a charge. So we ended up replacing that tablet with this one.  It was very easy to setup.  It doesn’t seem to be as fast as the old tablet  and it did NOT come with display mirroring like the older tablet did.  To me, that was a BIG disappointment.  Other than that, it is an ok tablet.  It does have plenty of storage, which is a lot more than my previous tablet. I do love the way I can charge it on charging dock.  That is a big plus!  Battery life has been great  so far.  Hope this tablet will last many years as my last one did.",,,,
4,,"GREAT Value - simple tablet with the basics If you have a newer, high end tablet, moving to the Fire tablet might seem like a step down (fewer apps, seems like slower operating speed). I was looking for a slight upgrade from my bare bones Kindle and have been very happy. The value is pretty incredible. I still treat it primarily as an eReader, but being able to quickly look things up while reading has been really helpful. There are some other neat features as well where it can almost serve like a portable Echo Show.One feature I really enjoy is the ""night time mode"" (they might call it something cooler), but it essentially removes some/all of the blue light so it is not as disruptive before going to sleep. I was not aware of that feature prior to purchase and I'm thrilled that it's there. This feature can be helpful for those - like me - who like to read before bed, but don't want the bright, colorful lights messing up their sleep.",,,
5,,"Love these Fire Tablets!!! I ordered this for my 18 year old for Christmas who is in the military. It’s small enough so he can travel with it and watch it on base in the barracks when he has some time off.He absolutely loves it and got himself an Amazon Prime account so he can watch movies, listen to music and get free Prime shipping. He installed Netflix, Hulu and a few other candle channels from Prime on it as well so he has the option of things to watch, because he doesn’t have a TV in the barracks.The quality of the picture is very good. I like how this is just as good if not better than an iPad and more reasonable in price. I’ve ordered a total of 8 of these pads over a 5 year period for the family ranging from the Fire Tablet 7s to the 10s.

I purchased it to consolidate my work life & it's been wonderful for that purpose. Plenty of built in storage & the ability to add up to a TB more with an SD card. It's also easy to install Google Play & install actual Android apps, rather than being constrained with just Amazon apps.In addition to it's role as my work tablet (handling mainly business apps), this device works great for streaming, web browsing, video chatting/conferencing, as a voice remote/Alexa device & so on. It also handles light gaming fairly well. I tried to rum Steam Link on it, but was unsuccessful. Steam Link is the only thing I've thrown at it so far that it couldn't handle. Combined with the very reasonable monthly payment plan option & the excellent support - I couldn't be happier with my purchase.Would buy again.Would recommend.",,,

Its a fine product if you are only using for reading/watching videos, not work.  It does occasionally glitch and doesn't play games well.  It works for what I needed.  If I had wanted a tablet to do everything a laptop or chromebook could do, then I would have paid the extra money for an Ipad.  That's not what I needed so the Fire suits me just fine.  It is much better than the Fire that my daughter has which is quite a few years old so some of the bugs of previous versions must have been worked out.

2,,,"Very fast and good audio/video quality! I have used this kindle for several weeks now and use daily.The audio, video, and battery life are excellent however, there were a few changes in design which I am not keen on. First of all, I would like to say that I could care less about Alexa and would like a kindle option without it. I am sure the program takes up valuable space in the device.-The charger plug is a different size (larger) than all my past Kindles and other android devices, so now I have one charger.-The on/off button has been moved to just above the volume controls which is driving me crazy as I  am consistently hitting it when I adjust the volume.-The width of this kindle is about 1/4 "" shorter than my last kindle so it doesn't fit into my case.-I also had a very bad experience with a CSR  in trying to prohibit the automatic advancement of TV programs.  The auto play is now stopped but the next episode does not queue and you have to go to seasons and episodes (an extra step) to choose the episode. The CSR said she did something on her end and I have no patience to call back.I have not yet used the camera or downloaded other programs.Other than what I have listed, this kindle is working great and is fast loading and charging. My last kindle kept overheating and finally died in under two years. I still have one of the first kindles which is super slow but is a good backup for shows and reading.",,

For several days I had a problem with my Washington Post app downloading  top stories at night (Interestingly, the problem never occurred during the day).  The app worked perfectly on my HD 7, which I continue to use, so the problem wasn't with the app. Numerous calls to Amazon failed to resolve the problem, but then for no apparent reason, the problem resolved itself, and the HD 8 has been problem free ever since. It is far superior to my HD 7, with very good battery life and screen quality.  Hopefully, the problem (which I have deemed a touch screen issue) won't occur again.  Otherwise, in every other respect I am very happy with the HD 8.",,,,

Plain and simple, it does what it is supposed to do and it is possible to put the Google Play store on it to make it essentially a regular Android tablet.The one thing I do wish is that the increased CPU and RAM came on the newest Fire 7 because the extra inch is a little bit annoying. It is more strain to get this situated in my hand(s) because of the added size.I have not used the camera and didn't on my previous one either.

My secondary use is to use text to speech for kindle books. (I usually read ebooks on a Kindle--easier on the eyes).It works well for these functions.My only complaint is that I cannot set the shut off for ""inactivity"" for more than 30 minutes.

No mirroring....they added a touch button bottom left corner...easily hit buy palm unintentionally and placement of power button...both can interfere while gaming....exiting game for another screen ill never use (new bottom left touch button) and unintentional pressing of power button...either opening camera or just shutting down screen...makes gaming with this tablet annoying.

Every Fire I've had has been this way.  I guess they figure they don't have to work too hard on the app since they already have you on the hook. One other issue with daily impact... When held in portrait mode in the case designed for it, the dang power button is right where my thumb is, so I end up turning it off accidentally every so often. It's like a hair trigger. Final word: adequate and sometimes tedious, like every Fire. My original Paperwhite is still my favorite piece of tech. Amazon has stopped supporting it. Hopefully, I can keep using it as is for actual reading for another good while. Fires are ok for light games and streaming only. Don't expect much and you'll be fine.",,

Works well as a Kindle reader and to watch videos, listen to Audiobooks, do some browsing, etc.  Much, much cheaper than an Apple IPad or a Samsung Tablet.  The trade-off is that you are limited to the Amazon Marketplace and Amazon advertisements.  Some of the Apps that I would like are not available through Amazon, like the Microsoft Office Apps which would work with my Office 365 subscription.  (I use OneNote a lot, so I have to do that on my phone when away from my computer.)I use my Fire HD 8 mostly as a Kindle reader and for a few games.  It is great for that.While there are some significant issues due to limited apps, the PRICE must be considered.  The VALUE bumps it up to 5 stars.

Currently using onedrive of all things for pdf's which is just not oprimal.Usb c is great!Battery life is excellent.Videos just look horrible though. Bad contrast and resolution is not good. It is like looking at a 2005 720p screen because it basically is that. Good for a pinch or for a kid.Data transfer spped is excellent.Comixology isn't bad for reading comics and the poor resolution doesn't seem so bad there.,,,,

2,"Fast and clean, annoying ads. This android tablet is really awesome and fast. Only giving four stars because of all the Amazon ads. Every time you open it or power-on it shows another ad which is annoying. But there are videos on YouTube showing you how to remove the ads using a Windows desktop computer... it's a long process about 40 steps and 20 minutes of time. You might enjoy all the crazy bloatware since it is showing you lots of cool different stuff going on in the world but after awhile I want it to look how I want it to look. No thanks I don't want to see a Pokemon add every time I open my tablet. Anyways the bang for the buck on this thing is unbeatable on the market. With 3gigs of ram its really fast and running all the apps I've thrown at it perfectly. The audio jack was a little sticky at first. Get rid of the ads and you have a 5-star product.",,,,

Problem is, if you spend the time to dig in the settings, alerts that look suspiciously like ads still showed up regularly (see photo, just one example of many).Amazon spammed me with ads after paying extra specifically to be ad-free. I'll wait for my refund.""Hands-free with Alexa, including on/off toggle."" This descriptor (current as of 23 March 2021) does not mean Alexa has an on/off physical toggle. It means you can toggle Alexa to still work hands-free. This is different, and not clear. I'd initially been excited (and surprised) thinking that there was an Alexa off switch. You can kind of shut off Alexa, but not for real.The systems is designed to pull up each setting separately, so shutting all the personalization and connectivity and Alexa creepiness takes forever. It's exhausting. A system update - that is also only compatible with older versions of my software (which makes no sense) - brought new settings to light. This installed Alexa communications that were automatically turned on. So if you have this and think you have Alexa turned off, dig deeper and check frequently.The battery life so far is nice. The speed is also better than my five year old steadily-dying Fire HD. But I certainly feel like I didn't get what I paid for.",,

The touch screen is great except it seems to be harder to swipe on it fluidly compared to my other devices. The battery life is really terrific, no complaints in that arena. Screen quality is fine as a whole. Another issue ive seen reoccurring is oddly watching videos. None of my other mobile devices experience issues with buffering via wifi. It's odd but not consistent enough to irk me. But overall for the price (if I were to have purchased it) I'd definitely say it's worth it. I mean serious bang for your buck here.

5,Internet usage runs the battery down very fast - disappointing... I find this new kindle MUCH harder to navigate than the 2 I have had previously.  I am also very disappointed with the length of the battery life.  It was advertised as new - priced that way too - SO I assume it is new...but when I use the YouTube or Facebook features it wears down in just a few hours not the impression I had from the ad I read when I purchased it.  Haven't tried movies yet but i'm sure that would be the same thing.  Also the book section is changed again more like how your phone works and it's hard to navigate as well - I was used to looking over my books to decide what to read again but unless you want to look at the whole library - not so easy.  BUT i'm trying to learn how to make it work.,,,,
6,"Incredible Device Especially at the Price Offered For about 1/10 the price of an iPad, I get approximately the same things. Plus, I can download my Amazon books in an instant. Only thing I would have liked to have the ability to interface with AT&T email but there is no protocol for that which I learned after a 6 hour trek through the Tech Support folks at Amazon Kindle Fire, Best Buy's Geek Squad, and the AT&T Tech dept. I am told that it does interface with other popular email servers like Gmail, Hotmail, etc.I also bought the Amazon Wireless Charging and Viewing stand ($40) and the OontZ 3 OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Portable Speaker ($26). All in all, it's damn near perfect.Ralph Carter",,,,
7,"Love this but... I have had other fire and the one thing this doesn't have that the others did, and that I loved, was the rubber like backing.  This one is very slippery. When I put it on my jeans to read it slides off the leg, so I have to hold it always.  I have a boat and this will slide all over the place in choppy weather unlike the others.  I got the stand charger and that is very nice and if i'm reading at a table is nice to put on the stand. Do wish it was a little adjustable, sometimes want a little more angle.  It also doesn't mark my read books correctly and am having problems getting it to sync up so my library matches my other kindle.  Other than those things I really enjoy it and would buy again.",,,,
8,,"Just right Great for reading. I finally replaced a much older Kindle that had become so slow it was annoying. The 8+ has solved all that for me. It has a really good battery life, nice features that allow you to customize it to your taste and a crisp screen. I debated between the 8+ and the new 10+ during Prime Days but settled on the 8+ because it is easier to hold and I don’t use it to watch movies or much else other than hours of reading books a day. Should I want to watch movies, I have no doubt it will be a great vehicle for that too. One of these days when my eyes need even larger print, I may switch to a 10+ or newer equivalent for the larger screen size; but for now, and especially if reading is your primary use, this is a great device.",,,

It felt sluggish and the battery life was poor. This new 8 Plus has addressed those issues and is quite pleasant to use.  Bear in mind, this is not an iPad , and there is a reason that an iPad costs several times what a Fire 8 Plus does. That said, this device fills a niche in between my Kindle Oasis and my iPad Pro, and fills it very well.The Fire 8 Plus is more versatile than the Oasis, and is lighter and more portable than an iPad. It's perfect for watching videos in bed or on the train, and the color display makes certain Kindle e-books more enjoyable than on a dedicated eReader.I feel like the extra memory and faster processor has brought this incarnation of the Fire 8 over the line from ""almost good enough"" to ""solid, fun to use, and versatile.""

But, it was time for an upgrade and I'm so glad I did!!  It loads quicker and has awesome color too.  I purchased it not as a gift and so Amazon loads it so its got many of my faves loaded already.  I love that I can dictate what I want to write, but discovered that a mini keyboard I had bought previously works for this as well.  So I can talk, use the Fire keyboard or dictate.

I recommend it for a smaller tablet alternative.",,,
2,,,"Works fine if you do not want any non-Amazon apps The hardware is good, the reason we returned it is that between the time we got our last Fire 8 Tablet and this one, Amazon locked it down so that only Amazon apps can be installed. Forget about your favorite Android browsers, games, or Cloud Library, which lets you borrow books from your local public library at no cost.The entire world of great Android apps and games is off limits.Am not sure why, perhaps the VP of Customer Discouragement (All companies have them) decided that this would pressure more people into paying for Kindle. We already have Kindle, the tablet is for other things! Perhaps somebody wants to use it to look at Netflix or Disney?  If so, forget it.This is a step backward, much like the old IBM PS2 boards and equipment so you have to buy it from IBM. That caused an entire marketplace to emerge with alternative open-source designs that did the same thing. IBM eventually had to sell off the PC business.  Locking out what the customers wanted did not work so well for them. We got a nifty Lenovo 8 pad, from Amazon even, and immediately felt the freedom of having choices and control. Much happier.Sorry Amazon, good hardware, bad policy.",,

9,Good Tablet for the price point This tablet does all the basics well. Reading and video viewing generally works well. It's a bit disappointing that new services such as Luna are not compatible with the Amazon based android tablet. The full android store is not available so basic android apps expected are sometimes not there. The battery does drain while in standby so software improvement might help improve this. issue. The touch screen can be more difficult to navigate for younger users because unlike an iPad the sensitivity for finger placement is not as forgiving. It has more ram speed than the current 10 HD and the size seems. more manageable for on the go use. Overall it is good for what it is at this price point. With a few software improvements this could be one of the best values available for any tablet. I hope Amazon continues to improve these smaller issues.,,,,

My husband bought me this new one as a gift .My old one still works like a charm, just gets a little warm. It is slow trying to use the internet, but still works. This new one just wasn't working and is made me feel very frustrated.Getting used to a new Kindle Fire isn't easy for me. It was upsetting when I couldn't download any of my books even though they seemed to be working fine the last time I used it. I have a Kindle Fire HD 7 from 2012 that I love, but wanted better faster use of the internet etc. The difference between the 2 is quite a learning curve. I have kept using the older one since it's so simple to use, but wanted to really start using the new one. I was not happy when I could not open or download anything last night. Thankfully, your Customer Service person had me de-register it and re-register it, and now it seems to be working fine. ThanksUPDATE 06/16/2021I went to read a new book and it would not download. I then realized all my KIndle Unlimited books that I had added in the last couple of weeks were not downloded either. I repeatedly tried to have them delivered to my new Kindle, to no avail. Finally contacted Amazon Chat and wasted a couple of hours trying to get them to download. I had read on the forum about several people who were having the same problem with their hd8 Plus Kindles. They were told to de register them, and then when they went to re register them, they couldn't!  I mentioned it to the customer service person, and he said to do it and told me how to re register it. So stupidly I followed his instructions, and now the Kindle won't even open! When I checked my order for it, iit says may be replaced until Nov 21 2021...so I asked for a replacement. Guess what, I was basically told too bad, they are not going to replace it! I have hardly used this Kindle, still been using my old reliable HD7 from 2021! I am beyond upset! In this day and age, who has that kind of money to just throw away for a piece of equipment that doesn't even last 7 months! If I had not listened to their customer service person, at least I would still have all my other apps and books. Guess Amazon is just too big now to care about their customers!",

It has shortcomings, especially overall slowness, and I have difficulty getting the back/home/all keys to appear on the screen. Practice will help. It has plenty of memory. My usual problem with tablets is loading too many apps.I was surprised that the SD card had to be specifically formatted for either more storage or as a transfer disk. I opted for more storage so that I could put seldom-used apps on it. It suggested, and moved Netflix to the card.

I took it on a business trip with me, and it was bright enough for me to enjoy a movie. I am not sure if it is as bright as my 10inch kindle fire, but it is good.Wireless charging - very clever of Amazon. It is a very useful feature.

This one, kept dropping signal. I couldn’t watch a 30 second video without the kindle stopping for no reason to buffer. Really?!?Now to the show mode... - it would be really cool to have this kindle on the wireless doc to be used as a echo show and then, I could take it to my trips to use it as a kindle. Oh wait, the speaker quality is so quiet, that I could barely hear it. Also, for no reason, the kindle would exit the show mode, I would have to take my attention away from my work to put it back to show mode.I tried playing a video from Amazon prime, in show mode, but the resolution was so poor, that I eventually gave up and went back to my echo show 10.At one point, during the day, the kindle decided it would be fun for it to lock up and restart and lock up and restart.***********Ok, I am hoping the one I received was just a defective, but in any case, I am returning this device.**********"

4,,"Happy for faster tablet So this is my 4th fire tablet. It's faster than the HD 8 from 2018 I was previously using. I play Township, not some high powered game and the HD plus does great with it. The 2018 used to freeze up switching from books to the game and back.I watch movies and use the plus as my backup zoom device when my laptop is not handy. DC universe does not like this device. Disney+, Hallmark Now, Hulu, Phillip and Netflix work great. 3M cloud reader, Overdrive and Hoopla (library apps) all work great. I enjoy Scribd on the HD plus also.I bought an anti-glare screen cover, and that made all the difference in the world. I still prefer to read on my Paperwhite. I side-loaded my Fictionwise and Smashwords ebooks with Calibre with no problem. I own around 3000 ebooks. About half of them are from Amazon.I got the 64gb because I was forever running out of space with Amazon downloading Prime Videos in my free space. Now I have no problems.",,,
5,"It's ok. Basic tablet for basic tasks. It is just ok. If you have owned any Kindle in the last 6 years... it is basically the same with minor updates.4 stars for meeting expectations of mediocrity. Not worse than expected, not better. Honestly, I wish Kindle would make a higher-end tablet, but essentially they have released the same product repeatedly for 6+ years.If you already have one that is working, no reason to upgrade. If you want one, wait for it to be on sale. If your expecting this version to be better than cheaper 2gb ram version it isn't. It performs the same for most tasks.It does nothing you can't do on a modern phone. It doesn't have the performance of a $400+ mid-price cellphone. It is an average device in every way, but it is good when you want a small device for travel and don't want to use it beyond basic tasks.",,,,

8,,,,,"Disappointed so far with 8+ I debated whether to get the 10 or the 8+ to replace my 2012 Kindle Fire HD 8.9. My first disappointment was the size choices. 8.9 was the PERFECT size - the size of an average book and easy to pack to go anywhere. Screen size was good for web surfing and watching the occasional movie, or in the kitchen viewing recipes. I ended up with the 8+ because a 10"" tablet isn't as easy to cart around. I may have made a mistake Even with a tape measure it's hard to visualize until you have it in your hand.  The screen resolution and sound on my Fire 8.9 was great. This 8+ resolution is a disappointment. Fuzzy compared to the 8.9. My smaller cell phone has much better resolution. Really Amazon you couldn't have provided better resolution on these? I didn't realize they were different until after the fact. I haven't had much sound experience yet so will update later but initial impression is ""meh"".  Another disappointment is that many of my apps I used on the 8.9 are apparently no longer available for Kindle. And all my Silk Browser bookmarks from the 8.9?  No way to transfer them over. Apparently the 8.9 didn't have the backup feature but it's been impossible to get any information on that. I contacted Amazon support and the rep started instructing me to go to the new device and ""import from Chrome"". Umm, Chrome doesn't work on kindle, I dont' have Chrome, how do i get my Silk bookmarks that way? I don't understand. Hello?  Hello? Silence - rep must have hung up when i started asking questions. I'm going to try one more time today before i wipe my 8.9 and send it back (I opted for the trade-in).  I'm glad I got a discount because it isn't worth it without one. I understand that these are affordable tablets not meant to compete with more expensive android tablets - that's not my point. My point is 8 years later, the 'upgrade' from the 8.9 to the 8 is actually a downgrade in some aspects. I did opt for no ads this time and more memory, so those are the positives. I hope."
9,,Trusty tablets This is our 2nd fire tablet. The first one I bought was a 2017 edition for my then 4 yr old and it’s still going strong. I’ve decided to upgrade her tablet and pass the older edition down to her younger brother. 4 years of surviving toddler and young kid wear. The things taken a beating with screen protector and case on it. It hasn’t failed us yet. And super affordable. The only negative thing I will say about it is the video quality on kids messenger (video messenger) is terrible (2017 edition we haven’t tried it on this one yet) other than that movie quality is great!,,,
0,,Great battery life Great battery life.  I can go almost a week without charging.,,,
1,,,,,"Show Mode problems Nice tablet, like the new shape, much more ""normal"", esp for reading. Marginally faster than previous generation, but not night/day. Wireless charging very convenient.I was hoping to use this as a Show Mode device, running an Amazon Photos slideshow background. I have a few Echo Show 5s around and they all work fine for the purpose - they aren't large enough to really be great photo displays, so the limitations are bearable. Problem with using the larger devices in Show Mode are as follows (and these have been around for a while - Amazon has no interest in fixing evidently): - Constant badgering with Try ""Alexa, do this"" advertising. I don't mind the option, but it needs to be something that the consumer can disable. Really annoying. Google Nest Hub does not suffer from this. - Photos are darkened, so that you can better see the Try Alexa ads I guess. This reduces the usefulness of this device as a photo display, as images aren't bright, even with device brightness on max.  I get it, running the photos on max reduces the usefulness of this as a smart display if I can't see the smart content...but when I'm not engaging with the display, why not just put a drop shadow on the content/clock and leave the photos alone? Or let me adjust the level of darkening that's done to my own preferences? - Worst of all, photos are cropped and stretched to fit the screen in the vertical direction. There are various cropping options in the settings, but they don't do anything - again, Amazon knows about this and isn't interested in fixing. Only solution is to pre-crop all photos into the exact aspect ratio of the display. If this was a 4:3 or 3:2 display you might not have to crop too many photos...but this is a 16:10 display, so every photo requires cropping.Really need Amazon to take the user experience seriously with Echo Show and Show Mode. It's a great idea, but from a usability view, Google is far ahead."

The battery lasts for days. I love the built in Alexa. I also bought the charging stand that I keep in the kitchen so I can use the Fire for recipes or to play podcasts and music. The camera is great, both rear and front camera operations. My first Kindle is a 10"" (never liked the carousel), and I have two 7"" (okay for reading), but this 8 feels ""just right."" Perfect size for reading, watching videos or playing games. Couldn't be happier with this one!",,,
5,"Hardware for the price is the best overall value out there; software not so much... The Fire HD 8 Plus tablet is an impressive piece of hardware that at the price without ads you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else besides Amazon. In dollars, that is.  The so called ""APP Store"" in the Amazon eco system is a joke with the only saving grace that its Silk Browser can do the heavy lifting to provide the owner access to such exotic websites as YouTube TV and American Airlines. Hardware is a big 5 stars, price a big 5 but the software is a negative 7.  Amazon should be embarrassed with the app store and do something about it.Bottom line, if you can live using the Silk Browser for a wide range of things, this is the tablet for you.",,,,

While it is irritating that Amazon automatically puts groupings of new apps on your home page as "" suggestions"" every other day, it doesn't take long to just make them go away.  Hopefully this kind of thing will stop.  It is a fast tablet with decent battery life.  I purchased the bundle including with charging dock.  The charging is nice and quick.",,,,

I got it for my son on sale for prime day, and I can’t believe what I got for the money!  The screen brightness, touch response, and overall availability of applications stands up quite well to the much more expensive iPad.  My last experience with the android operating system years ago left a bad taste in my mouth, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it has caught up with the functionality of iOS.  I like this little tablet so much that I picked up the 10 inch HD version as well.  It really does everything that I wanted it to and is a viable option if you want something with general apps on it comparable to an iPad without dumping all of the money into it.

I upgraded due to the fact that my charging port on my old Fire was a little wonky. The new tablets have the USB-C charger which is a nice upgrade and longer battery life. The 6 months of Kindle Unlimited was a no-brainer and a welcome addition if you use that service. It also has Alexa integration which I havent really messed around with.

I don't need a full blown Android tablet because my laptop is more useful and converts to a tablet.  This is a great tablet for prime members as Amazon offers a wide range of features included with membership.  I don't miss the Google play store because my phone has that covered.  I like having dedicated devices because they run their software much more efficiently.  That's why Apple has a loyal base.

The screen, although smaller, is so easy on the eyes. I loved watching movies etc and reading books. The stand now eliminates the need to repeatedly connect manually the charging source to the Kindle and also provides a permanent location for charging  it, so I can find it.

The new one uses the USB-C cord so it seems sturdier. Everything was working fine. All my MOBI books and PDFs, including a few of my own publications, would open and read with only a handful of textbooks whose text wouldn't align correctly on the page. I can live with that. As a professional archaeologist I have collected a number of academic books and articles, many very difficult to find. I use the device on sites in remote places so I do not have to lug around a half dozen huge books everywhere. The ease of carrying a single small device is the entire reason I purchased the Fire. The device didn't care where the documents were purchased as long as they were properly formatted. On September 4, 2021 there was an operating system update. Now 98% of my documents are no longer opening. Some just give me the cover page and freeze while others show the cover page that changes to a ""DRM protected"" error message. By allowing this Amazon has become a gate keeper, a policeman directing traffic. They are the ones making the decision what you can load to use down the line. And, surprise surprise, if they aren't making money on each and everything you load they are denying access. Greedy corporate BS. After hours upon hours trying to remedy the situation on chat and phone calls, the guy finally said ""It is the publisher's fault"". Bull crap, bud. It is your device, it is your update. It is changing the game midstream. The sales pitch is that it will allow you to read publications in any format. That is a lie. It won't even allow me to read PDFs that I create right here on my own PC. It is shameful greed and the customer service is weak. No one is sticking up for you, the consumer. No one is actually helping. I need a tablet device to bring reference materials to the field. Looks like Amazon is selling bricks with huge promises for a tiny return to the customer. If you want a device that provides reads without the policing and nitpicking, try anything but a Fire device.",

Dont they realize people get accustomed to a design and dont want to have to  use one way to turn on a tablet while your other older models use a different way? Very inconvenient. Also the on/of switch is now jammed in close to the volume controls so you now switch off your tablet inadvertently while trying to change the volume.

It always seemed like plugging in the charger is what caused her to kill her device.The screen image is sharper and I can make the fonts a lot bigger so she can see Moore clearly. The HD 8 plus also offers support for other keyboard & dictionary languages and I was able to set this for her so she could use FB to talk to her friends from the old country.Purchased a Finte case [B089SHK374] which still allowed for wireless charging using the Kindle dock [B085RVS6FV]. So far she hasn't used the Eco show feature but I did notice that the Kindle was able to charge using my Belkin Qi phone charger. So if you don't need the Eco show feature, you might not need Amazon's charger.",,,
3,Good Product As Always I have to get used to it. This is my 4th Kindle and I love the product but I'm finding this one hard to figure.I'm reading a book. Everytime I go to find it I have to search for it. Why doesn't it stay on the home page?Also every book I've ever ordered shows up in the kindle section. If I put hide it goes into some kind ofdownload hell and I have to turn the kindle off to use it again. Never does hide the unwanted library items.Like I said maybe this will get better after I've used it a while but it isn't as user friendly as previous models.,,,,
4,this product will preform as advertised. this is one of many fire tablet's that have been in our house. with hour after hour of book to read and candy crash games as proof of products worth.,,,,
5,"A great tablet, with one glaring problem. I bought this with an eye towards taking advantage of the wireless charging/Show mode feature, and after a couple of weeks I packed away the stand and went back to using it like a normal tablet. Why? Because having this device and other Alexa-enabled devices in the same room is a nightmare. First, it's not possible to utilize other languages than the default, so I had two devices using the British voice and this one stuck in plain American. Also, you can't add it to a room, so if I said ""lights off"" while facing one direction I'd get an instant response, while if the tablet picked it up, it would ask me which lights I meant. (Often, both things would happen simultaneously.) Other than that it's a great tablet, just consider how useless the Show mode is right now unless they give it more functionality.",,,,
6,,,,"Did not make it past first base.  Screwed up my other 4 Kindles as well. I have been an ardent supporter of the Kindle series since the first white kindle with push button keys.  I own almost 900 books, 300 Audible books, 70 movies and 1511 periodicals, am adamant fan to say the least.  I have owned 7+ Kindles over the years and this is the first time I am able to provide anything but comments of disappointment.The new Kindle 8+ is a dismal and un-useable failure.• The major problem is the interface.o Amazon has reduced the number of tabs to locate content from 7 to 3. The idea being that it simpler to find everything on one page -WRONG!• Where it took the tap on one tab and one tap on the item you were looking for, now it takes between 7-9 taps to find a single file.  This is ridiculous.• Amazon dis not inquire of Super-Users as to the desirability of this change, Amazon JUST PUSHED it out there for all to SUFFER through.o To add insult to injury, the 5 remaining kindles my family has – they pushed this UPDATE out to all. Amazon provided it users with no alternative but to use this new interface, YOU CAN’T SWITCH AND YOU CAN’T REVERT TO A PREVIOUS REVISION OF THE OS. My family and I feel now we have a very expensive boat anchor that will not get any use in the future. Conservatively we have spent on devices and content approximately $2500-3000 since Kindle came on the scene.  We never even looked at NOOK. I now have 4 requests for Galaxy Tab as a replacement.• Other problems include; When using the Amazon approved memory expansion card the system does not automatically save content to that device. We have 300 Mbs at home and the download speeds for the Kindle 8+ are significantly slower, do not begin immediately upon request, and fill first the internal memory. Transfer from the internal memory now must be done manually to the external Expansion card. The GUI is extremely poor and the resolution of pictures and movies is even worse, because it is done by pushing ALL content into a single tab,.It is unlikely that any of these comments will get through to the public, but I thought you ought to know that customers do care about the products and prefer to be asked if they want improvements, that are not improvements.",
7,"Great for the price! This was the second Kindle Fire I have owned. This is a great price if you want something for your kids or an ereader for yourself. It is adequate for searching things on the internet or using social media.I keep mine in the kitchen and I like use when I am cooking either searching for recipes or watching something on one of the apps.  Sometimes trying to use the touch screen is little bit of a pain because it feels like you have to press harder than say an Apple ipad.  Still though I would recommend. Like I said, great for the price.",,,,
8,,,,,"Even after removing ads, this is a commercial-riddled, overpriced tablet. The screen is fine.  It connects to the internet adequately.  It refuses to pick up books loaded onto an SD card unless you lock the SD card to the device.  I have no opinions about the camera or its quality.But this will AT. EVERY. OPPORTUNITY. scream at you to spend money.  Front page?  Buy an app.  Book library?  Get an audible subscription.  Searching for something you've already loaded, first let's look at a related item you can purchase.  Dedicated button that says ""library""? Not your books, that's the app store.  ""For You"" page?  Things `for you` to buy.  Newsstand?  Pay for the Washington Post!  Music page? Even if you have Amazon Music, you should subscribe to Amazon Music.  Videos page?  Guess what, you don't want to watch your videos you want to rent or buy movies off of Amazon.There are almost 10 dedicated storefront portals on the device.  (Those that are through so-called ""apps"" cannot be deleted, but they can be swept into a folder where you can try to ignore them.)To reiterate, this is on a device with ""special offers"" removed.It is possible to diminish this deliberate defect in the device by activating ""airplane mode"" and then rebooting.  (At least disable the WiFi, if you want to use Bluetooth for headphones.) This cripples the device, though, blocking access to network hosted media and, of course, netflix, et al.The speakers produce sound.  They do not do it well.  The volume rocker can double as page turners but work backward (left button turns the pages to the right and vice versa).It's a bit better for reading comics/manga than one of the glow-in-the-dark kindle papers, if only because of the expandable storage and color screen. As I mention above, the device seems to hate indexing books uploaded to the SD card unless the sd card is formatted to extend the base storage.This is *still* a worse tablet that the Kindle Fire HDX 7"" released over 5 years ago."

My old one I had ran out of memory strickly with OS updates ( frustrating) but I decided to by a newer one cause I enjoy reading ebooks.  Addtionally, I thought this device with the faster chipset and more memory would be good for other things as well.  I am a little dissapointed because I thought it would be faster, I still encounter delays at startup and opening ebooks I was reading and the ""show mode"" had a lot of potential but this implimentation is kinda useless.All-in-all I love kindle books and the larger screen is nice so no regrets, but its important to remember what it's made for - reading ebooks.",,,,

That was 3 tablets ago my second one was bought in 2018 and lasted until this year of 2021, this is my third fire tablet and they just keep getting better. I am quite pleased with my HD8+, especially with the extra SD card I bought with it for storage as I have a large collection of e-books and the SD card allows for all tone downloaded as well as many of the apps in order to save the onboard memory for running all the apps without degrading performance of the unit. I especially enjoy running Alexa in Show Mode while the tablet is in it's wireless recharging cradle and it was well worth the separate purchase of it.",,,

I have a larger tablet  that I am very pleased with, but I wanted something easier to travel and be able to consume videos and music and of course have my apps work fast.I saw the new HD8Plus so I ordered it and I am very pleased. It loads quickly because of the extra ram and the screen seems much more vibrant. My apps load quickly and I can have several tabs open while surfing with no slow down. I did sideload Google Play just because I use Google apps for writing and being able to get my work on all my devices.In short, I am very happy with everything on this tablet. No regrets at all.",,,

Screen quality is good for the price, rather pay less for these specs than higher, but certainly not the same compared to higher end devices. The device overall feels like a quality device and doesn’t have a cheap look or feel, very classy looking.I would like to see less restrictions with using google apps or better integration of certain apps that would make this device more useful. You are restricted to the Amazon App Store and they do not offer certain apps needed in today’s environment. Hopefully they will improve upon this. I give it 5 stars because I was completely aware of what I was getting & this tablet is perfect for our needs. If you are in the Amazon Ecco system, this tablet perfect. We do use Amazon.",,,

It’s fast, the screen quality is better than the 7 for sure and the same as the 10.

6,,,,,"Show Mode not so Usable if You Have the Dock If you just want this for portable reading, it’s an excellent choice. However, I wanted it to also function as a portable Alexa, my primary use being to listen to my flash briefing every morning all around the house while taking it with me.  However the speaker is terrible.  Too soft even at max volume.  I miss my portable Amazon Tap with its great sound and a good microphone.  I also bought the kindle wireless charging stand so that this kindle can function as a bedside Alexa but half the time I’m having to repeat myself.  This is not true with the other Alexa devices I own including the echo dot and regular echo, both previous generation.  If you intend to watch movies or listen to radio with this device you’ll need to connect to an extra audio speaker as this device won’t cut it.That said it’s fast and a pleasure to navigate as a tablet.  If the audio and microphone were better it would be a killer device.Bad audio, good visuals.** UPDATE **The last software update (Nov 2021) seems to have addressed the volume issue.  The maximum volume is louder now, and satisfactory for listening to news and podcasts.  However for a few months now, Show Mode doesn't work right.  I have the dock so that I can use this device as a clock and Show device.  Display Settings for Show Mode let you select different views, like Travel, Art, Seasonal, Abstract Shapes, Minimal.  But only Abstract Shapes is displayed, no matter what mode you choose, and the latest software update makes even that display mode almost unreadable because the foreground color of the text blends in with the background color.  Not sure why this hasn't been addressed after months."

They do however provide you access to the Amazon Play store. However if you're a regular Android user, many of your loved apps are not available on the Amazon Play store.The other item is speed. I purchased the 3gb version because I do know that ram provides a processor space to work. However apps can sometimes take time to load and even going into the devices settings can lag. I'm taken back by this and have been considering return the device due to this. However the price of this tablet when purchased verses the prices of other tablets on the market have made me hesitate on returning it.",,

It does not offer the same high screen resolution as the newer upgraded Kindle models, but it is plenty enough for easy reading!!! It is  just so much more versatile. The only things I am not (yet?) quite happy with is that I can't figure out how to manage the markings. They come on and off when I touch the screen and I often have to eliminate an accidental marking of a text passage. And sometimes when touching the screen a little clumsy, I totally lose the location in my book - not just a few pages, but many chapters. And I haven't figured out yet whether and how to get back to my previous location. Probably will figure it out over time. Overall, extremely happy with this device.",,,

1,,,,"Horrible tablet - Don't waste your time Holy cow, this tablet is TERRIBLE.  I don't understand how there could be so many good reviews.  I ordered the FireHD 8+ tablet on the Black Friday special.  I already have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8A from 2017 and I thought I'd ""upgrade"" to a newer tablet.  Big mistake.The FireHD 8+ is somehow slower than the 4-year old Galaxy Tab 8A, which was a low-end tablet.  I compared them side by side.  The Fire was substantially slower to open apps and navigate.  I paid extra to get the Amazon tablet without the lockscreen ads.  They're correct - no lockscreen ads.  However, about 1/3 of the home page is taken up with messages (advertisements) from Amazon that I couldn't get rid of.  (""Register for this..."", ""Register for that..."").  There was only room to have two row of apps visible on the home screen.Don't get me started on the browser support...  You can only use Amazon's Silk browser, which is an awful excuse for a browser.  It is SLOW, CUMBERSOME, and UNINTUITIVE.  Naturally, it is so bad that Amazon does not allow us to download any other browsers, such as Edge or Chrome.  OK, I can understand that they don't want us to use a Google product, but why not Edge?  They offer many other Microsoft apps in the Amazon Appstore - why not Edge?  Is it because, if they did, NO ONE WOULD EVEN CONSIDER USING SILK?  Even Apple has enough confidence in their own products that they allow us to install browsers other than Safari - and we can even designate those other browsers as our default.  Not Amazon!  They're afraid of the competition.  With good reason.Spend a few extra dollars and get a different tablet - one that is made by a company that respects their customers.  By the way, I'm not an Amazon-hater.  I buy thousands of dollars of goods a year from them.  They offer terrific customer service and great prices.  I'm just very disappointed in my purchase of this tablet.",
2,lots of new features but slower while the picture quality is great and all the new features are great it is much slower than my old kindle. I love how it goes to Alexa when I dock it in the Alexa dock. when I used my wireless head phone on my old one it automatically synched but with the new Alexa I have to go into settings and find recently used devices and synch it. I could put my old kindle to sleep mode and the battery would last weeks but the new one keeps draining the battery if it is in sleep mode and not docked. in all I feel it has really neat upgrades but like any upgrades in new technologies it came at a cost by losing some of the older features that were beneficial,,,,

For what I use it for, it works great.  I kind of like the  feature to Alexa.  I've never used Alexa before so still getting to know about that.  The price didn't kill me, but still sad I had to buy a new one because my older Fire wasn't being supported anymore.

6,,,,,"Good for reading ebooks, not much else I really miss the HDX! I read reviews, figured this would be okay and since my 2nd HDX had died I needed another tablet right away. This one is okay for reading ebooks, not very good for other things, especially anything to do with typing. Have to constantly make corrections because keyboard isn't easy to use.  Even hitting the buttons I want isn't easy, I accidentally ordered two book sets because the tablet lags. Got refund for one set, having issues getting refund for second (both in same series by same author, customer rep was not really proficient in English, and both sets were same price, and to further confuse things, both were same price as my monthly kindle unlimited subscription).I need to find another tablet, maybe a Samsung, will keep this one strictly for reading but will be a hassle switching between them. Seems to me that kindles  have been degraded into ereaders  only instead of the all-purpose tablet that the HDX was. Disappointed!"

1,,,,,"Not ideal to use as an Echo device I bought this tablet along with a stand mainly to plan to use it as another Echo device with a screen. Turns out it doesn't work nearly as well as an actual Echo Show.Firstly, the mic was much less responsive. I find myself having to talk directly and loudly towards the tablet and still often unable to wake it up, while an actual Echo device can hear me much easier.Secondly, the speaker isn't nearly as good as any Echo - even the most low-end 1st gen Dot. This may not be a big concern if you don't plan to enjoy audio content, but it is so bad that it's noticeable even during casual conversations like asking for weather.Thirdly, it doesn't support choosing a default external speaker for playing music or other audio content. This is supported by all Echo devices but not Fire tablets.Lastly, when it is in Show mode, whenever it gets an update and installs automatically, it quits Show mode until you activate it manually next time. This is very annoying because I don't want to repeatedly manually enable Show mode every other week, and as a result, for 80% of the time it just have the display off.It is an inexpensive tablet with lots of powerful features on paper. But having used iPad for 10 years, I was so unused to the slowness and lagginess of the Fire tablet. It took like 20-30 seconds to enter Show mode, and the first time I was doing this, I thought the software crashed but then realized that it is the norm for this tablet."
2,"Still no screen mirroring! Gave it a 4 star rating because there's always room for improvement. I have had Kindle fire tablets pretty much from the beginning when they first came out and I use them a lot. I would have given a five-star rating if only Amazon would have  reinstated the ability to mirror the screen. I have an old fire tablet that had that capability and use it frequently for that very purpose. Why Amazon took that capability away from its fire tablets is an unknown conundrum to all of us Kindle fire tablet users. Every other device has that ability. Amazon, are you listening to your customer base?? There's lots of similar comments about the loss of screen mirroring out there on the internet. Take a look!",,,,

I do more leisure reading than anything else and find that the 8"" screen is too small, having become used to the 10"" reading field on my previous Fire tablet.  A 10"" screen would have earned a 5 star rating in the overall and screen categories. I will upgrade when the 10"" version catches up with the current 8"" model.I really like the convenience of wireless charging.

Fire 8 Plus has some improvements but overall quality not so much. The sharpness in the screen isn't there compared to the older version. The new one seems to lack overall quality, just feels cheaper. I paid extra for no lock screen ads and suddenly a box pops up almost daily on the home screen with some amazon related product. It's easily removed with a ""long hold"" at which time you can choose ""interested"" or ""not interested"". Needless to say I'm NOT interested.

I bought this FireHD 8 plus just so she could play Roblox cause I felt bad on the horrible phone. This tablet was way cheaper than buying a samsung phone or tablet but works just as good.

I checked with Tech support and they claim the system takes up this space.  8 Gigs!  And told me if I have owned other devices I should know this.  Not the best answer from tech support.  We will keep the tablet and add storage as necessary.  But, I wasn't please with the answer of the tech support person Ayush.",,,,

I love that everything I need is in such a small package, but not so small that I loose it in my purse when out and about.  I can listen to an Audible book, watch a You tube video, check my E mail, search the web and maybe even watch a movie on a screen that is larger than my phone's screen.I also really like that the Fire Tablet is sturdy and dependable.  Everyone I have purchased has been dropped, more than once, and yet still continues to work.  ( I would not recommend dropping your Fire Tablet, but in case you ever do, you might find it still works just fine.)",,,

 Like all the qualities of the kindle fire he 8 plus. The picture quality is good, it’s fun to watch some shows while on my lunch break or to read. The one thing is that I’m not sure if the power button is supposed to be at the bottom or the top. The case that I got for it has the camera and the power buttons on the bottom of the device. But when I go to use it, it definitely shows that some things are upside down. Otherwise I’m liking the tablet so far.",,,,
9,,"Great entertainment I use this like a smartphone or a Kindle or a TV or a radio. The screen is good quality for watching movies which is what I mainly use it for. The color, sharpness and contrast are all beautiful, much nicer than my portable DVD player or computer screen. The sound is OK for a non-dedicated music player, I haven't tried ""good headphones"" yet. It was super easy to set up and use, of course, all Amazon stuff syncs easily and is easy to find on the pages of the tablet. If you can work a Fire Stick on a TV this will all be easy and familiar to you. I haven't tried the camera yet to gauge its quality only to see that it comes up on the screen, it does. My TV blew up and I think this tablet will be a fine cheapish fill-in for now.",,,
0,,Great for its price You pay about 1/3 for this tablet of an iPad. Some try to compare to an iPad which is impossible bc they aren’t even the same product. Many have concerns bc of lack of apps.

1,"Great tablet but could do without the ads This tablet is highly functional and easy to use.  I recently bought a cover that included a screen pen; works perfectly with the tablet.  However, whenever I open the tablet and enter my pin, there is an ad waiting for me, every time.  This is annoying.  I gave this tablet a 4 star, instead of 5, rating because of the ads.  I'm a prime member and I bought this tablet at a great price on HSN ($79.99)...but I think I should've done some research before having made this decision. One last thing....I love Alexa.  I've asked her about a hundred times to tell me jokes.  She does tell some funny ones.",,,,

3,"Love the kindle, ticked off at the price The item price went down by 23+ dollars within the first week and when I called I was told that to secure the better price I would have to return the item and reorder. What a waste! So the company would have to sell my kindle as used, I would have to go through the hassle, and I would pay less for my new one!  Usually vendors honor the new price within a few days if purchase... pretty cheap shot if you ask me. So Because I like the kindle I am biting the bullet, but it left a sour taste in my mouth for sure",,,,

And it charges faster and the charge seems to last longer.***UPDATE*** I'm going to go back to the 10"" Fire. The new 8"" Fire HD+ was at first very snappy and responsive but as I've used this almost exclusively, the tablet does have its shortcomings.It likes to stall and become unresponsive at times which is why the deduction of two stars. It does seem faster but if it continually stalls the speed then isn't a factor. I've waited for the tablet to become responsive for up to a minute or so,so that in itself negates how fast it is. Until they can fix the responsiveness I would hesitate to make this my main tablet. I had such great expectations for this tablet but it's a flaw that i cannot overlook!The On/off button is on the side as well where if you hold the tablet in landscape you have a high probability of accidentally turning it off as you hold the tablet.

Access to some items have changed, but thus far have been able to find what I need.  Needed to call support to ask about back-up, very pleased with the system they have. You ask for a call back within the kindle and the call back is immediate.  I tried asking Alexa about my question, but she could not help with that.  Still learning what I can ask Alexa to do.

I bought one a few years back and had the same difficulty si I gave it away,  navigating this one. As can be expected the commands are not the same as windows or an Android and I have had both. I tried to move DOCS to Silk on the home page and it has totally disappeared and I can not retrieve it.  BTW that is where it said it was and it was not.  I have spent the last 3 days trying to navigate this and I know I am not the smartest computer person but this ridiculous.  At this point, I am waiting on the wireless charger and debating with myself about sending it back.  If someone could tell me how to retrieve DOCS I might change my mind. I found where it says it is still on there but I can not find out how to retrieve it to Silk or utilities. ADDITION COMMENTS. After I posted this I got a request to chat about my problem. I explained it and in the middle of the help session, I got a call offering to help from their Jamacia help center.  A very helpful lady named Sasha solved my issues. But I will say that all computer interaction that I have the developers want to prove their superiority over all other mortal men.  They are not aiming very high when it comes to me. I am 77 and grew up in the days of the phone party line.  I will say that there is no problem with the Amazon Fire HD8 Plus except the developer try to make it better than Goggle Android and they did not succeed.  They all should use the KISS method.  The main problem turned out that the page that I was to go to download Google Play was missing on my Tablet. So when I tried to go there it froze. I had better quit now, THANKS again SASHA."

2,,,,,"I love Amazon devices but... Fire HD 8 plus is a great tablet, however mine developed a pinkish and blueish red Line vertical red line on all pages which makes for poor viewing of Amazon photos or any other display purposes. My order states that it may be eligible for replacement for 1 year. Customer service states that it is no longer under warrenty. (90 days only for this model). This is clearly a hardware defect, as evidenced by another reviewer with the exact same issue. It has not been dropped or physically mistreated in any way. I have purchased many Amazon devices and always received excellent functionaliry and customer service from Amazon. But this device let me down and customer service would not entertain the possibility of repair for an obviously factory defect in this tablet. The price is fair, the functionality is great, but lack of QA for hardware screen performance has left me with a sub par device."

I will see if I can find somebody locally you're going to assist me in changing the search engine and being able to open the apps, if I cannot find such a person, then I will have to return the item.

I had to return it because the battery kept draining even if it was on standby mode.  The battery life is nothing like what is described.  Drains really fast if you use text to speech.  Touch screen is not accurate.  Downloading books from the library can be a tricky business.  I get error messages then,  if l restart then tap the book again,  it will finally download.  Adding the memory card was also no walk in the park.  First it didn't accept it,  then I contacted Amazon and found it had to be formatted for the device.  That's never happened before with any of my Fire devices.  Sound is not as good as in my old device.  Also doesn't access apps our run any faster than the old device.  One lat thing, this ""upgraded"" device doesn't even mirror to my Fire Stick.  By and large,  I'm tired of waiting on support and getting new devices.  Shame on this new device.",,

Kudos to Amazon on that one!).But as an e-reader, alarm clock and occasional fill-in for my cellphone and laptops (search functions) this new version of the Fire has been very reliable, does what it's asked and the graphics look nicer than my older Fire.

The only complaint I have is with the table's back up and restore process which is used to help users migrate to a new device.  I did a back up for all my stuffs from the HDX 7 and then did the restore to the new HD 8.  However, all the documents I saved on the older device did not get restore so I lost some documents which I wanted to keep.  If anyone knows how to fix this, let me know.",,,,

8,"Faster, More Stable Bought this to replace an older Fire 8 that was beginning to lose wireless conductivity. The book size is right for me, but if you watch lots of video you might consider the larger Fire 10. As others have said, it is not really a complete tablet, more of an Amazon gateway device. That said, it does work well as a morning news reader, facebook checker and e-book. Probably not the best at high intensity games, but altogether competent at wat it was designed to do and at a really fair price. It also has the newer charge port which is a major improvement.  Might not be an iPad, but you will be getting more than your money's worth. Know your needs and your budget, and choose wisely.",,,,

I can connect it to my hotspot as needed and keyboard/carrying case I bought separately works great.  I am impressed with the battery life.

It's great for reading (Kindle) books and watching video when you are in waiting room situations.  I do wish it wasn't so slippery.  I thought I could get away without buying a cover but I  know longer think its possible.  It would be great if Amazon would expand their apps to be more mainstream or allow downloads from other sources without having to edit their configuration.  I ordered one a year ago and returned it because it was just too SlOW but the new 8inch 3GB ram makes a big difference.  I am really like this one.  It has greatly reduced time spent on my laptop.,,,,

I got it with the magnetic charging stand and am glad I did. No more fumbling with a cord to keep it charged.My huge beef with it is the storage. While Amazon advertises huge expandability (up to 1 TB if I recall), the don't mention that it won't support any files over 4 gigs which means you can't watch your own HD movies. This is a conscious software decision on Amazon's part as other versions of the Kindle handle it no problem. If they'd upgrade the software, this IMHO would be a five-star device.",,,,

5,,,"Feels Cheap My previous kindle was an HD 7 from 2015. It felt like glass, this new one feels like plastic.I do like the lighter feel but the screen is not as nice to touch and although the picture quality is better and the sound is much improved the overall experience seems chintzier...but maybe it will grow on me.Also the home screen is much less user-friendly. And why oh why did Android drop the feature that allows volume control from the swipe down? This loss is significant since volume control is very cumbersome on the tablet itself. Clearly they expect most people to be holding this for movies or etc. but i still prefer to hold the tablet vertical most of the time which makes it harder to use esp since it's so easy to accidentally press the sleep button.And I guess Amazon thinks all its users are neo-liberal corporate media consumers since a dip into the News app that came installed is nothing but a who's who of liberal fake news inc.  I'm not a conservative but if i were I would be rather offended that the people who own our culture feel that half the country can be safely ignored.",,

They are sending me a return label ands refunding . GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE> In addition, they are passing on feedback to their developers. The biggest one is you should ALWAYS be able to get to the home screen with just one touch. Thank you AMAZON !I am not a technology newbie. I have owned a variety of PC's, Ipads and even FireHD but this has got to be the worst user interface i have ever seen. First, to find the home screen with my apps only seems to happen by accident. If I could figure out how to repeat it would be great. Would it kill them to have a universal home button?I have tried sweeping, touching, etc. No avail. The top pulldown for some settings is semi useful but again, how about a home button?if I am IN an app like amazon music, I have some fair control of that app but how about CLOSING the app when I dont want it anymore ?Then there is the cradle - you know for charging? Well, if its in the cradle and say I start music, it immediately goes to sleep, blank screen. And yes, I have pushed the button that says ""show mode"" . Great, now instead of the music app showing STILL alive, I get a ad or screensaver.I would LOVE to like this. I dont. I hate it and if I could I would return it and buy something with a usable interface. My 10 year old FireHD had a better experience than this."
1,,Perfect for Creating Smaller Spreasheet at Work Being about half the size of my IPad I can take to work and create smaller type spreadsheets to track my concessions sales and settlement sheets. The Kindle HD Fire saves me time by reconciling $4000.00 to 12000.00 in sale by performing the math and without any mistakes. The Kindle allows me to save 20 to 60 minutes a night so I arrive home timely.I love the Kindle for my purpose of helping me at work and it’s the perfect size to carry to work also !!!!!,,,
2,,,,"Prepare to be annoyed... It's still early days yet, I've only had my Fire HD 8 Plus tablet a week or so, but thus far I'm quite content. Actually, my rating is based more on how dissatisfied I was with my Kindle Fire 7, than this tablet's own merits just yet. I use my Kindle's mostly for music. Listening and buying. And the Kindle 7 was awfully slow and glitchy when I tried to access anything from my music. Towards the end it took ten minutes or more to load my playlists. Granted, I have a lot of songs. But still! Ten minutes! So far my Kindle 8 is very fast and responsive. Not at all glitchey. I truly hope that lasts. Otherwise, my five star rating will plummet. The one game I play, World Golf Tour, looks absolutely gorgeous onscreen! Like I'm really on the golf course. Overall, I'm very happy I upgraded to the 8. The docking station I purchased separately is also outstanding. I would add two pieces of constructive criticism I hope Amazon will heed in future models. The on/off button and the volume controls on the side should be more clearly marked so users aren't fumbling around the unit trying to find them. They need to be white or some other bright color that stands out on the unit so they're easy to find. Also to the Powers That Be, please don't slow up a user's music library by trying to get them to join this, that, or the other Amazon club! That's soooo annoying!Updated review: Well, it's been a few weeks now since I got this version and my opinion has drastically changed. My rating has plunged from four stars to ONE Star. First, unlike most Kindle users, I use my Kindle primarily for my music. Music that I've BOUGHT and should be able to play OFFLINE any time I want to. Not so with this version of Kindle! Time after time I get a pop up message that says I need to be online to complete the task. And yes, I've made sure I chose OFFLINE music (this is my third Kindle Fire, so I know how to navigate it properly). This is infuriating!!! A Kindle user should ALWAYS be able to access his/hers music offline any time they want to! Sometimes I can play my playlists ofline, sometimes I can't. No real ryme or reason. Why is it that earlier Kindle Fire versions were more user friendly, Music Wise, than newer versions?",

Best Tablet available for the price in my opinion. Got it for 35% off and would pay full price for it knowing what I know now.",,,

9,"Best value tablet for media consumption...especially if your okay with amazon watching you. Privacy in today's digital world is an illusion. That said, amazon's newest fire tablet is a great value when on sale for $80. This happens fairly often, so be patient. I deducted one star because amazon wants to sell you a wireless charging stand and tablet cover that cost just about as much as the tablet itself and more than the base model. Solid build quality, good screen, solid battery life, quick charging and reasonably responsive. My cons are really nitpicks, no access to the google play store and the button layout. If you are just interested in reading, watching and listening this is great tablet at a great price just be aware amazon is data mining the crap out of you but you probably already know that.",,,,

1,"Excellent for gaming This is very good for word games, puzzles that I like to play.  It was a little disappointing to find out that the reader is not as good.  It no longer allows you to change the background to black with white lettering.  That is the easiest on the eyes and I've  used it since my first Kindle in 2012.  Now I have to go to my other ones to read, and just pick this one up at other times.",,,,
2,Affordable tablet Nice little tablet with a convenient charging station. Keep next to my bed as an alarm and bed time reading. The Alexa feature works well. Very nice for the $$,,,,
3,,,You get what you pay for Product has a good screen. Touch features works good. The Silk search feature is not as accurate or as precise as google searches. Emails are slow to load as are some websites. I bought this tablet because I have purchased 2 DragonTouch tablets that worked great until they didn't. I did not want to replace the DragonTouch again and it quit working in a few months. I bought the Fire tablet for less than what I paid for the DragonTouch. The Fire tablet is slower and does not work as efficiently but if it last more than 3 or 4 months it will be worth more than one that has to be replaced every few months.,,
4,,,"I really wanted to like this tablet but.. I really wanted to like this tablet, but I started having problems right off the bat. It started with the screen glitching and straight up not responding to any touch, then it started turning off and restarting by itself. The tablet was also slow at loading apps, I felt like I was waiting too long for an app to open. After having it for maybe 3 days and the tablet restarting itself and glitching multiple times, I had to return it. I don’t know if my tablet was just defective but it was really frustrating. I might try to give the newest fire 10 a chance, but still on the fence and really considering just getting an iPad.",,

I didnt need to purchase a charging pad, this work fine with the one I use for my phone.This is replacing an HD 8 6th generation.  These devices really do last.  I don't really notice any difference in speed or handling.  I did need to replace the micro USB charger because this uses USB-C.

I usually use a Laptop, which I still like, but I can print from my new Kindle and do many things with the smaller ""tablet"" size of the Kindle. I am very happy with it and recommend it to anyone who wants to do more with their KIndle than just read books but not spend a fortune. Oh, it comes with a ""regular"" wire charger. Well worth the very reasonable price!",,,

Everything was supposed to sinc and switch from my old to the new, some things did most did not. No matter what I've tried I can't get my email to load to the new one so I keep using my old one to check my email. I've even had my techie son look at it and he can't do it either. He seemed to think it may be a glitch in the hardware of the new one. I'm keeping it because my old one only works when plugged in. I'm hoping it will grow on me.",,,,

The touch screen doesn’t always track my finger which can be mildly annoying. But this may be a lag issue in some of the games I play rather than the screen actually having an issue. My bf got the wide screen fire tablet that didn’t come with the extra ram. Lemme tell you! I find the difference pretty big when playing heavy games like hearthstone. He has issues with it crashing, and Ive never had a problem. So I’m really glad I picked the extra ram option.

0,,,,,"AI Virtual Amazon Store Front, Limited Apps The hardware and specs are decent/good for the price you will pay. The software seemed a little unresponsive at times though very visually appealing at the same time. My main issues were with the concepts and execution of the actual device along with the monopolistic and limited access to standard/business applications in their app store.When you login to the device, which utilized an amazon account, you are greeted with a quick tutorial and then afterwards you scroll through the different main screens. The main screens are not like a normal tablet. One is the amazon store, then Audible, Prime Video, Bookstore, Prime Music etc. That is not necessarily bad it is just frustrating that you cannot utilize the tablet without being bombarded with AI advertising and not even open an application. The other really infuriating part is that they utilize their own app store which does not have nearly the same selection as the Google Play Store or the Apple Store. A very popular app ""Square"" used for POS systems was unavailable. All in all The price is solid for what you get, but be warned this is not like an android or apple device. It has its own Operating System and has the same purpose, like everything else amazon does, to sell you another item."
1,,"Kindle 8 is GREAT! This is my 4th Kindle and 2nd Fire. My first Fire started running slow so I decided I needed a new Kindle. I bought a Kindle Paperwhite because I liked that it is water resistant and doesn't have to have a the back light on to read it. Once I got the Paperwhite I quickly realized I didn't like it. I stuck it out with the Paperwhite for a while dreaming of a new Kindle every time I would prop it up on something and it would turn off. When I got the email that the Kindle 8 was out, I knew it was time to jump. I LOVE this Kindle! I love the charging dock and the fact that it becomes a clock while it charges and while it's ""asleep."" I love that the blue light can be reduced for reading at night. I pretty much love everything about it!",,,

4,,"works good Works ok for me, I watch Youtube, Facebook, email, just the basics, this tablet does fine for all that. The touch screen is a little sensitive, I end up on videos that I didn't mean to click, swipe on. Battery last most of the night, the color is very good. Nice tablet.",,,
5,About the same as previous versions but hate the rotation settings Seems OK. Auto-rotation is wonky. If you have it turned OFF so the device is displaying in landscape and then go to Instagram (which only displays in portrait) it doesn't revert back but stays stuck in portrait. You have to go into Settings to fix it.Had to get a new case of course; the buttons have been moved on the side. Cord that comes with device is about 3 feet long so I had to order a new longer charging cord.Updated: Sept 13. The Auto-rotation is just about a deal breaker. Some parts of Facebook will make it display in portrait and it won't revert without going to settings. If you let the rotation float then it is constantly changing from tilting the device.,,,,
6,Great Inexpensive Tablet Can't be beat for the price. Good screen and lots of apps,,,,
7,,,,,"So slow - stay away if you want entertainment This tablet is soooo slow. I bought it on a whim for a long flight so I downloaded a bunch of movies and TV shows on it. Once it gets playing a video it mostly performs fine. However, everything leading up to it is a challenge. Apps constantly minimize or close while you're navigating them, streaming will often pause over and over despite good internet connection, touch screen navigation is slow and lags between clicks and drags. Overall, if you want a tablet for entertainment, I suggest reaching for something slightly more expensive and for the tried and true brands like Apple and Samsung, etc. Like many of the products I've purchased over the years from Amazon, I'm usually *surprised* when the product I receive is actually decent or good quality. Their tablets seem to be in the same category and a cheap knockoff of other quality products."
8,,,"Great tablet except for one glaring problem This is a great tablet, a significant improvement over the previous 8"" Amazon HD tablet -- except for one big error. They changed the form factor, with the new one shorter and wider. As a result it's awkward to hold in my average sized hands while the previous tablet was a lot more comfortable.It's not that the actual screen size is any different. The screens on both tablets have the same form factor and aspect ratio (8"" diagonal). No, it's in the bezels. For some reason they decided to move the front facing camera to the left side of the tablet instead of the top, and that makes the side bezels wider while allowing them to shorten the top and bottom bezels. The result is much more like a Kindle reader in form factor, except it's larger. A Kindle reader is comfortable for me to hold, but this new tablet is not. I don't know why they did this except maybe they expect people to buy the case and have you prop it up on a table to watch videos and act as a Show device.Other than that this tablet is an improvement in every way. It's definitely faster. Apps load quicker without any hesitation. If you can stand the form factor then it's definitely worth buying.",,
9,,"Better than 7 inch We have previously bought the 7 in fire tablets because they were cheaper, but I am glad to have bought this one. It is so much better than the 7 inch tablet. It has a better quality screen, lag time is minimal compared to the 7"" fire tablet, and the battery stays charged longer.",,,
0,,,,"Don’t waste your money. Nothing but issue after issue ***Update***Still wouldn't waste your money.  I've now talked to tech support three times now.  They sent me a replacement, which was a refurbished one. Not what I originally purchased. When it arrived, it had scratches on the screen and I couldn't even register it.  I still can't purchase books or borrow books from my KU. I have to use my phone or my paperwhite to borrow or purchase and then hope i can send it to my fire.  This is absolutely ridiculous! I spent over an hour on with customer support and now they're sending me yet another fire.  I'll be up to 3 at that point.  Just hoping one of them might work.So this is my 5th Kindle Fire (and I also have a paper white) and I’ve had nothing but trouble with this since it came out of the box.  I was so excited to get a faster processor, thinking it might become more than a reader for me, but honestly it doesn’t even function as a kindle most of the time. I’ve called tech support, emailed with them, but it still doesn’t work correctly.  I’ve reset to factory settings at least 3 times and completely started over.  Sometimes my books will download, sometimes not.  I have some random books with blank covers that won’t open and when I tap on the cover and ask to open in the bookstore, it says that it can’t find the page.  Which means that I can’t redownload to see if that would fix the issue.  The frustrating piece of this issue is that it might be there when the kindle first starts, but then it will just randomly disappear from both my downloaded books and from my library as well.  Once it disappears, it doesn’t seem to come back. So right now, my library looks a little like Swiss cheese. And with close to 1500 books in my library, I’m not sure which ones are missing. For the first 3 weeks or so, I couldn’t purchase any books or borrow any new titles thru KU. That was finally fixed, but now there are other issues.  If the software would function, it could be awesome.  But right now, it’s a ridiculously expensive paperweight.  Please do yourself a favor and save your money and the headache until this is corrected.",
1,"Nice tablet, but awkward placement of front facing camera I have both the HD 10 and new HD 8 Plus. I chose the HD 8 Plus for the wireless charging and wanted something easier to hold in one hand. That second part is where the issue is for me.  When holding the tablet in my left hand my thumb tends to sometimes cover the front camera which causes the display to dim. I like leaving the auto-dimming enabled, but we'll have to wait and see if I either:1) learn a new way to hold the tablet2) turn off auto-dimming (Adaptive Brightness)3) just live with it as a minor annoyanceIn all other ways, the tablet has been exactly what I was looking for when I chose to get something smaller than the HD 10.",,,,
2,,,Good hardware build quality but lacking software. This tablet has a good build quality but it is lacking in software. The Fire TV and Fire TV Stick have built in screen casting but the tablet does not have a built in client. This is annoying as my internet service is metered and intermittent making streaming impractical. I tried using some of the 3rd party programs but all they do is display an add to purchase a premium version. This is annoying because I download content for offline viewing at the library but can't easily watch it on my Fire TV stick.,,

Battery life is good too.Plays my action and adventure games on high res without any hiccups and loads them faster. 32 GB and  you can put a memory card up to 1tb. 3 RAM allows it to do multiple things such as watching a YouTube video while doing other things on the tablet, without losing where you left off.Cons: certain apps and games have crashed.Did a speed test with my fire 8- 8th gen and it seems to be a little bit faster loading games.. but not when accessing things like the camera or other non game apps.  The software makes the tablet run very sluggish...you think it would run faster with more RAM and a better processor.. this is really disappointing... I hope they fix this issue. Same screen resolution as the previous generation.The power on/off button and the volume buttons are too close and I sometimes accidentally shut it off.  This can be annoying.If you have the fire 8 --7th or 8th gen, and it works fine, consider upgrading only if you really need to.I'll update this review when they update the software to increase performance.",,

6,"Some useful bells and whistles The battery on mine seems to draw down quickly.  I know they said it would be a 12 hour battery but mine doesn't seem to last that long.  Also, when the battery gets low, it seems that my screen brightness fades slightly in and out which is kind of distracting.

Final update 6/20/21Don’t buy not worth a penny of the price.Can’t even use, constantly calling to address issues.Update 3/5/21:Don't buy any of these if they are for your kids.My daughter is 9 and she accidentally did a factory restore.I set a separate password for my account and had her child account on it.My daughter doesn't do anything without permission and she came crying to me thinking she broke it or something.She is no longer able to use it as I don't want something in her possession that has no stable security.I now am using it and it is truly aweful.Slow, constantly restart it after downloading a lot of things, constantly says it can't read a 64gb micro sd card.Don't buy. I got taken. Too slow for anyone who uses tech. Too annoying for anyone to have to learn.No support for real apps.As an adult, throw your money away on an ipad.Even though you cannot fix it yourself, it is still far better than this.Leave a sense of wanting. It's a bit laggy, to the touch load is delayed. Response delay, that is noticable.Screen seems too dim, not able to get bright, watching some movies or videos you feel like your missing what is happening.Sound is meh. You should definitely buy headphones or a speaker to connect.Does run smooth when processing things.Doesn't feel like power is there for the specs it boasts.Lack of quality apps leaves you wanting more.Great source of education apps and books access.1/4/21:As of today I lowered the rating. There are times when my daughter (who I bought it for) has issues using it. The tablet refuses to respond a lot of times, it won't load things, when using the search bar, it only looks for stuff on the device, then other times it will search the internet. Using Alexa is very flawed. Alexa is not consistent. There is no real App selection.Not happy, don't see any reason to validate getting the 10 with a more powerful chip as this one has more RAM which should give it better response time. These tablets need a quad-core chip with 4gb ram at least to do what they want it to do. For the price without ads, it should do more. Also still get ads even though I paid for no ads.",

They definitely go hand in hand! I enjoy the youtube app (as well as the Google app store) - so I was hesitant on the Fire tablet... but you can download .apk files on the internet- which is simple after watching a tutorial on youtube! :) With the ""normal"" youtube app, from the Play store (NOT the amazon store!), this is now my favorite device. I don't have to watch movies, shows or videos from my phone or the TV. This is the perfect in-between!Bonus: Charging is a C-port. I can use my phone charger if need be.",,,

All 4 of my former Kindles worked well but the charger ports broke so couldn't charge them and the last one the battery just keeled over.  This port on my 5th is really a tight hold on the plug.

Always love these, the power is great for the price, 80-100$ for 3 gb of ram on a tablet or 50$ for 2 gb such a good device on a lower ram model is still a steal. They read and browse great, and the extra money for ram really makes a huge difference playing all the games it could. If there's one complaint, sometimes i feel like the models are just a bit like 0.5-1 inch just too big to fit in a single hand or stretched jean comfortably like the fire 7 models were, but the screens are pretty good. They're great power for the price and good for reading or gaming though.",,,
9,,,,,"Not an hdx replacement, agreed with other reviewer I have two fires,  2013 hdx 8 and a kindle 7 in bright green and I love them both,  my nephew plays minecraft on it.  I watch Netflix and prime.  The design and the feel,  fit and finish were ahead of its time.  The battery is starting to not last (it's been 8 years! ) so I figured Amazon's latest and greatest 8 plus would be a no brainer.First thing, I take it out and the build quality feels lower,  less robust,  plasticky.  The next is the seven feels the same and it makes a plastic noise when you touch it.Third,  there's lag (yes I turned off all animation lag) when I scroll it takes a second to register before moving.Fourth,  maybe it was a glitch that doesn't happen often but I'm literally asking Alexa stuff and she's stops listening and turns off. I try again,  she does it again.  I have several echoes so I understand the quirks.Lastly echo on a tablet doesn't make your tablet do things.  Alexa,  open this app.  It's just an echo.Sad,  I'm a fanboy too.  I was at best buy and saw the new echo spheres and I think at this point Amazon is just trying to maximize profits (hopefully not with the drone or the new shows)  but the build quality isn't there.I think current adopters are fine because they didn't have the older models but if I let you borrow my hdx and even the 7, you'd be like why isn't it 10 times better after 8 years.Hopefully Amazon you wake up and do better"

I have no problem with the 720p screen quality or non-blazing performance when all it's doing most of the time is sitting there showing album art. Most crucially for me, it plug-and-played successfully with a 12 year old USB headphone amp/DAC, hooked up via a USB-C on the tablet with an adapter to an old-school USB / mini-USB cable. Another pleasing thing is that it works with any QI charger, of which I had an old unused one, so I can just set it down on the charger at the end of the day and NEVER have to worry about the battery even though I have the screen on and bright for hours a day.Fantastic value for the price for my usage scenario.",,,

Maybe I don't use it as intensively as some? Mainly use as media player and secondary screen for school. Battery life does not seem very superior. The shortened bezels gives the table a squat look, I prefer the longer previous model. Volume is not very loud (& volume booster apps make it sound distorted). Fire OS is about the same as always, still no real personalization or options. Cannot say this is a superior replacement for previous model, even with increase in RAM. Review I read puts this model on par with smartphone from 5 years ago.Still, I am not a tablet-intensive person & think it is a fair price for what you get. Wireless charging is a plus, even if charger was overpriced, it is one less wire to drag across the desk.",,,

End of story.Why can't Amazon offer a higher end tablet with exceptional definition?This is ok, and cost about half what my HDX, cost but the experience is really half also.What I don't like other than the lower definition, 1. The tablet is thicker, and harder to hold on to for me.  2. The headphone jack port, is way down on the lower right hand corner edge.  The hdx, had the port right in the middle edge, affording me a place to place the jack shank in the webbing between thumb and forefinger of my right hand. I'm left handed so this was perfectly comfortable for my situation. Now I'm forced to grip the top corner of th fire which after a few minutes makes my hand go numb.The button to turn it on is on the edge also where before it was on the back on the opposite side .I know some of my complaints have to do with getting used to a new device with stuff in different positions , but it still irritates me that I can't get another HDX!!!!! Not to mention the ""full"" screen isn't really full screen.If I can't get used to this fire soon, I'm going to be looking at other brands of tablets, with better options and screen definition.The Only thing I like about this fire HD is the charging dock.  That is it.  Other than that I have nothing stellar to say.:/"

8,,,,"Ads even without ads I have other tablets. I have an Echo and 4 dots.  I thought it'd be nice to get this, though I have an old Fire, for updated text-to-voice in the kindle app and to use it as a Show  on the docking station.  Well, the sound quality of those voices is worse  then on my 2013 Fire. The speakers are poor. And as for the Show mode- it constantly has messages about ""Alexa Skills"" scrolling across the bottom, totally ruins it.  If I want to know how to do something with Alexa I will look it up.  I thought it would be nice to  have a kind of central control of devices and music with weather, calendar, images -  but no, CONSTANTLY  pushes Alexa Skills.  Very, very tiresome. And you can't. get. rid. of. it.  Nothing in settings will get rid of it.  I even called customer support.  Even in the the Alexa app I can't make  this constant ad for Alexa skills  get out of the way of what I am trying to do. If you have an Echo- they're great.  If you have an ipad or Android tablet - They're great.  My 2013 Fire would have sufficed for text to voice. I wanted this as  a means to an end, not as an end.  Amazon and Alexa are  great services but they need to get over themselves.  I was quite enchanted with the Echo but now I'm sick of Alexa.  THIS TABLET is THE WORST for viewing recordings from my Blink cameras. and ""Live view not supported on this device!""  And ""Waiting for Blink"" (it never happened) I can view them on my other tablets - I use them as bird cams- clearly, smoothly, quickly. On the Fire 8+ they are worse than jerky slow-mo. This tablet is USELESS. AND VERY VERY difficult to navigate even though I am considered the techie among my friends.",

I use the old ones at work in my medical clinic for the kids waiting to be seen. I have a regular tablet but always reach for my kindle instead. The battery on the 8 plus is pretty good but will drain quickly on standby. Other than that its great for the price and quality is as good as a regular tablet. One little thing is I wish I could download Google play store. All in all I recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet. If you love reading there are 1000s of free books to access. Outstanding product! Thank you Amazon!!!,,,
2,"Had high hopes for this gadget Its battery life is great. The screen, when in focus is really sharp. Reading books on this tablet is a pleasure. My problem was when reading our newspaper, as I get deeper into the paper, the page on the screen takes longer to come into focus, until sometimes I just give up and go to my laptop to read the rest. This did not happen with my old HDX.ANOTHER thing:  There used to be an app for reading my Outlook eMail and worked very well until it didn't - on my old HDX. when I spoke to support the rep was unable to help, and suggested I delete the app and reinstall it. Guess What - there is no app for Outlook any more.",,,,

The reason I got this tablet was so that I could watch Netflix and Disney+ on a bigger screen than my phone, since my television doesn't really do either very well.While this is technically an android tablet, it is first and foremost an Amazon tablet.  It is geared for your Amazon account, and it does this extremely well.  It's super easy to order books, and it is a great e-reader. Ordering stuff from Amazon is also streamlined.  Amazon Prime video does great on this well.You do not have access to the Google Play, and the apps you can download are rather limited.  Unsurprisingly, it does not support Barnes & Nobel's nook app, and since that was my first e-reader and I have over a hundred titles on that device, and I still order titles for the nook when it is cheaper than kindle, which happens on a regular basis.  What was surprising is that Duolingo is not supported.  I was hoping to be able to move my Duolingo activity to the tablet for the larger display and be able to free that space up on my phone but no dice.Still for $60,  and a 5 payment installment plan, I would get it again.",,
5,"Weird camera placement I love this device.  I picked it up because, as is usual with all kindle fires, my previous device was just slowing down too much.This fire is everything would would like with the usual fires but faster and a bigger memory.  The only complaint I have is that the camera is placed on what would be the top of it when it's horizontal.  When you turn it vertical the camera ends up on the side and if your not paying attention, gets covered by your hand while you're reading.  Which means that the brightness diminishes until you remove your thumb.  Easy enough to change the settings, but a pain because you normally forget.  Not a big deal, just an observation.",,,,

Besides having a usb-c charging component, the battery lasts at least one full day after gaming, reading or using others apps. I couldn't do that previously. If I did, the charge would only last about 3 to 4 hours. It fully charges very, very quickly in comparison too. Very nice. Now if only AMZ would figure out how to put paperwhites anti glare screen on it. That would be the only fire update I'd consider making in the future... just as I'd only update my kindle paperwhite if it at least had a usb-c charger, and a color screen would be nice too.",,,

Unless you buy the amazon case for this fire you will have a difficult time finding a case for it. Most aftermarket cases open left to right for some reason.  The camera is in the wrong place on the new fire it is now midway down the left side instead of the top. and often used controls have moved to the top of the fire. Also the charging wire has changed to a smaller plug,,

Also, the audio is very muted. 50% on my older tablet is roughly 100% on my new one.I had to replace my 2 year old fire tablet because the software updates were using all of my onboard memory. The one software update I wanted was a functional Audible app. They don't seem to have this as a priority. The Audible app I got on my android phone 2 years ago is light years ahead of the current one on this tablet.

I wanted something bigger than a cellphone to preview the picture before printing it. The picture quality is equivalent to a Polaroid (for those that remember them.) The aspect ration is not 2:3 and it cannot be changed. So it's either add another step before printing to edit the photo or draw black lines on the screen. The screen doesn't get bright enough for use in the sun. This is what I get for using a book as a camera. I should have went with a refurbished iPad mini.  On the upside, it's the only way to watch video's from Amazon Prime offline. This and the long battery life makes road trips enjoyable. It's easier to use it to order stuff from Amazon compared to getting out the laptop or squinting at the cellphone.

I'm not a fan of the Apple ecosystem, but that's the route I need to go now.I purchased this tablet and when I received it I was shocked at how small it is...it's tiny. The next thing I found out, the speakers are all but useless. My phone is much, much louder.I wanted a Kindle that could read to me and that I could use for looking stuff up or planning routes from my hotel room when travelling. This is not that device. It also has some odd placement of icons that can't be changed. Oh, and even though I opted to pay extra for no advertising it kept throwing ads at me suggesting I should watch Prime videos, etc. NO, NO, NO!!! I don't want to...and even if I did, it is doubtful I would be able to hear or see anything on this, whatever it is supposed to be.. If the room is completely quiet and I aim the speakers right at me...I can sort of hear this one. My 2014 HDX has excellent sound and I can hear it fine, even with the shower running. The earlier device is also the same ""size"" class, but looks like a giant next to this thing.Did I mention that this thing is tiny? I don't even think it is the size of an iPad mini...it is crazy small.In the end I had to send it back. I truly hated it. I'm now going to cough up the money for an iPad Pro. I know I'll be a bit locked into their ecosystem, but it can't be as bad as this Kindle.I would also like to mention that if you are thinking of buying the wireless charging dock, don't. It has a proprietary wall wart (seriously, a wall wart in 2020) that takes up more than a standard plug of space. Why can't it be USB like everything else, then I can just plug it into my multi-charger I already have. I truly disliked everything about this setup.I would give it negative stars if I could.",

It isn't very loud, even when turned up all the way, but it works with Bluetooth speakers/phones.  If you want to use regular old headphones  you may find the headphone jack to be a bit strange (it sits off center and makes it hard to insert some phones); I haven't been able to make that work yet, but maybe it's the earbuds rather than the Fire.",,,

The viewing experience at 8"" seems cramped, and after a week or so of using it I still notice that.

It is very slow and often unresponsive unless you have time to wait around for several minutes for simple functions like 'play this song' to be possible. The wifi is slow and the battery life is so-so. Even though the plastic case is thin and flimsy the device is heavy in the hand.  The buttons are poorly placed and very easy to accidentally press.  I purchased this device for one purpose: To connect to my stereo to use Amazon Music HD to stream music and store offline music on the tablet to play through the stereo. The device reportedly handles up to 1TB of added storage in the SD chip slot.  I added a 512GB SD chip of the fastest-rated SD chip I could find. I have not added much content to the chip, because the device is so cludgy it can't even really just stream music reliably.  It often takes forever to display an album, a songlist, list of songlists, or a song.  Very often once it shows the album, song or whatever.. the play button won't light up.  You may as well go put the tea kettle on to wait. So I can for sure say don't waste any money on an SD expansion chip.  The tablet's chipset and the 3 gigs of RAM simply can't handle it.  I think this tablet is best to read a book or have a toddler watch cartoons.  Also I paid extra to Amazon specifically to NOT display ads, however every day there's something new there added to the home screen which violates our agreement.  Very shifty and irritating. The apps in the amazon app store are not very good especially the browser. It will make you not want to browse the Internet.  I have read you can install the google app store to get better apps, like a decent browser, but the overall misery of using this device is such that I don't care to bother with that. On to craigslist now to sell this thing and try to forget about it.",

It loses the signal repeatedly; the wifi indicator shows different strengths in the notification bar and the settings menu; and while I can have full signal strength on any other device sitting next to the Kindle Fire (including new phone, laptop, desktop), this Kindle Fire sometimes cannot even find the same signal.Battery life - no better, if not slightly worse than previous models I have had.  about 4 hours or less of video, and about 6 hours of reading a book.  With brightness below 50%.Screen lag - OMG.  I cannot stand it.  Inside a book, the lag is less than ever.  That's the bright spot.  Opening an app, including an Amazon app - its better to put the device down and find something to do than stare at the screen waiting for it to load.  Ditto for downloads - although this may be due to the awful WiFI signal reception instead.  Its hard to tell.This feels like two steps back for the Kindle Fire.  And its too bad.  I'm excited to have USB-C finally.  I got the Kindle 10, and felt that there was a performance issue, but it wasn't my primary device, so I can live with it.  But this? no, this is poor performance.  Something is amiss in Kindle land."
8,,This is my 4th Kindle Fire and i love it. Love everything about it. I like the size. The touch screen is great and the battery life is the bomb. This is my 4th one and I love it.,,,
9,,Works well for my purposes This Fire tablet replaced the earlier version. I use it mainly for reading and travel when I don’t want to take my iPad. I like the feature that turns off the blue light.  My only complaint is the position of the wake/on-off button. It is in a different place than on the old 8.  I often hit the volume button instead.,,,
0,"pretty good affordable tablet for media or entertainment use if your looking for a affordable tablet for just media or entertainment use this will be perfect, the screen quality is pretty good its definitely not high quality like a galaxy tab, but if your using it just to watch youtube or watch tik tok or anything else similar i wouldn't see why it wouldn't be suited for such thing.  also good tablet to use for twitter or facebook or instagram, but i wouldn't recommend using the camera on this tablet for such apps lol, other than that it also has great battery life i've gotten more than 2-4 days of use before charge.",,,,
1,,"Good product, fair price. Just a reading tablet for books.",,,
2,,"A worthy upgrade from my previous Kindle. I am a long time Kindle owner going back to a gen 3 with keyboard. I reluctantly upgraded from that one after breaking the screen. This purchase was to replace a Kindle Fire with a messed up charge port which is why I chose the Fire HD 8 Plus with cordless charging. I have no regrets for this purchase. The screen is bright, the battery lasts longer and the charging dock is great. I have no problems recommending this to anyone. I haven't watched videos on it yet because we have really slow internet. This Kindle has the USB C port as an improvement over the micro-USB of the previous one. The only minor complaint is lack of color choice.",,,
3,,"Great Tablet, Great Price! At first I was hesitant because the inclusion of ads sounded like a bad idea. Turns out it's great, when you wake up your tablet there's an ad you swipe up and then your tablet works. It's a great way to get a great quality tablet at a great price. I additionally purchased the dock that it sets in so that whenever I pick it up it is charged to 100%. No need to deal with plugging in a cable that will inevitably break the cable connection jack. I've had it for a couple months I haven't noticed any kind of performance issues, and I think it's great. I predominantly use it for web browsing.",,,
4,,,"Good device, bad software changes The main reason I loved my last gen Fire 8 (and the Fire 10 I still use) was because of the ease of finding new things (especially books) to download. Want a new book suggestion? Swipe left. Want a new app suggestion? Swipe left again. The last several months I noticed that my recommended pages were pretty darn bare. I discovered why after buying this new Fire 8 plus. They had changed the page layouts for the new device and it was impacting my older ones. They removed all but three of the layout pages. Now there is only the For You, Home, and Library screens. And the library screen is pretty darned useless. And now to find recommended things, Instead of one click, I have to navigate through several clunky screens. The hardware is definitely improved though. This Fire 8 plus feels so much more responsive than my last one that was a few years old. Though, again, they changed the layout of the device itself. It is now setup to be more compatible with Show Mode. Which is pretty much useless.",,
5,It makes all books as unread - pain to locate read vs unread I like the fire HD tablet just fine. My tablet quit working just a few days after the warranty but whatever!  I replaced it with the same type and level of tablet. What I don’t like is that the downloaded books all come across as new and I have to open the book and go to the last page as if I had just finished reading it and then it automatically goes to my “read” folder. I have thousands of books and have just the “unread” list at the ready!  This a pain in my you know what!,,,,
6,,Great value Bought this as a dedicated monitor to automatically show video from Ring alerts (using routines) and it works perfectly. Was debating between this and an Echo Show but glad I chose this because it’s totally portable and can work as an Echo Show too. Really convenient and great value.,,,
7,,"various problems I use my Kindle for reading most of the time.  I've had to compare with the kindle I had before this one as not everything transferred when it synced.  And, I have problems with this kindle doing anything.  The latest was getting any of my books, read and unread, to open so I could choose one.  And I couldn't get candy crush to come up.  I finally turned the kindle off and waited for a while.  When I turned it back on, it had corrected itself.  But I have a  problem quite often.  I seem to be able to fix it each time by turning the kindle off.  But, that shouldn't have to be the way its done so I can use the kindle.",,,
8,,,,,"Slow, frustrating and often crashing I bought this dirt cheap on Prime Day and used it for some traveling. I thought I knew what I was getting for my money, but it definitely is worse than expected. I used it for reading (probably the one thing it did the best, but I still like my dedicated Kindle better), watching movies from saved files (does this OK, but is slow to load and start), and streaming (unusable for this, as the apps are constantly crashing, take forever to load, and are just buggy compared to the same apps on other devices). Forget about web browsing, games, etc. Now that I'm home, it's a paperweight."
9,"Good tablet At first, it did not seem to work properly but with the help of amazon service all the glitches were fixed and now it performs as described by the company. I still love the 10 better and will probably trade it in for a 10.(maybe because I had the 10 for so long)Amazon helped me fix what was not going well and now I can say it is a very good tablet. I must also commend the customer service at Amazon. I have always had positive interactions with them and this time it was fantastic.",,,,
0,Screen quality pleasure,,,,
1,,"100% Recommend! 5 out 5 stars So far I am really loving the Kindle Fire HD 8 Plus! So happy I went with this one. I saw the reviews for Fire 10 and they weren't that good. A lot of people said the Fire 8/HD 8 Plus is way better and that they wish they didn't switch. I have the Fire 7 and half the apps I used to have don't even support that ""generation"" so basically there is no point in using it. Even Amazon isn't supported by it anymore. You can't use Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Youtube etc on the Fire 7.  For HD 8 Plus the screen quality is amazing, same with the sound and battery. I love it. The price is definitely worth every penny.",,,
2,"The OS kind of sucks. The OS makes it harder to navigate around returning books from KU. And it doesnt always DL the books to the device, depending if you ordered from your email. The menu system is inconsistent and difficult to click on depending which area you are in. It's doable but not as easy as my Fire 8 was. The one physical thing I didnt like too much was they stretched the width and made it more uncomfortable to hold, and you cant use a cover or aftermarket knob to hold because of the wireless charging(which I do like a lot).",,,,
3,"Entertainment yes, books not so good I bought this so I could have my games and books on one device. The game part works fantastically. The book part is horrible. It does not bring you back to the book you are reading if you leave the book section. It doesn't keep you on collections either you have to select it each time you enter into the books section. If you use collections you are unable to see the stragglers that are not part of collections. In short the book portion is not user friendly and if that is the reason you want this you are better off getting something only for books like the paperwhite.",,,,
4,,"Handy Fire tablet This product came handy and a great substitute for the e-ink readers like Kindles. But unlike them, sure is a tablet with with multi-purpose usage e.g., netflix, email checking literally anything you can do on a tablet. I just wanted to point out why the quality of screen is just 720 instead of 1080p. Hoping that they upgrade Amazon Fire HD 8+ with 1080p feature. There's a Fire HD 10 with 1080p feature though but my concern is, the size too BIG for my hand haha.",,,
5,,,"Poorly labeled. I specifically got this product for my 5 year old to experience her Osmo games and other learning peripherals. After doing research as to what models and types will work with the hardware and software, it was determined the 8th generation works with it, but not any newer generation. So I looked at the different types of Kindle Fires and bought the ad-free Kindle 8 HD.THIS IS NOT AN 8th GENERATION. It is a 10th generation that is not labeled as such, only as a Kindle 8. It is because of the 8-inch screen. I purchased all these games and equipment for my daughter because I thought this Kindle was the 8th generation, only to have a very disappointed 5 year old who could not play with her Christmas presents because hours of research meant nothing because of poor labeling.Despite this, it’s an okay tablet that is neither Apple nor Android. Usability is a little frustrating because of this and the responsiveness is nowhere near that of iProducts.  As a cheaper end tablet, it functions decently for the price. Don’t expect miracles.",,
6,,Wow I love it. Shopping since it’s still new I haven’t put a book yet but I believe it will be fine,,,
7,,"Very response & easier to navigate in landscape mode. Compared to the older fire HD 8 models from the last few years, I find this tablet to be impressive. Not only is the screen quality better on my eyes for reading, the video quality is clearer, too. I'm impressed with the response time when navigating the tablet and I appreciate the larger storage. I actually prefer the design of this tablet. The shorter and wider screen makes typing and operating the device in landscape view easier then prior devices. The location of the forward facing camera is more convenient for me as well. My only draw back is when I'm watching videos, which I do a lot on this device, I still have to charge the device sooner then I would like, but it holds up longer then my last fire tablet.",,,
8,,Love it. Love it.,,,
9,"Overall good for the price Battery life could very a bit better, but still a pretty good product.",,,,
0,,"It is a step above the 6"" Fire but gives me much more screen to view! I mostly use my device to read with, but sometimes watch movies on Prime or Netflix. I play a Wordle game while I drink coffee in the morning. I do love to play the audio without buying the audio books. They are really high quality.",,,
1,,"Love this kindle it is faster than the others This kindle is really nice for doing things on and it is so much faster than the regular kindles. The screen has really nice quality, the battery life is great also and I really love the touch screen.",,,
2,Small but it’s ok for some games Too small has limited use except for some games,,,,
3,,,,,"Randomly turns off. I love Kindles for the ease and convenience of having so many books in one place. This is why I will always choose a Kindle. being able to download streaming services we already use is just a bonus for travel. I never typically have issues with them. However, since I have started using this particular one it constantly and randomly shuts itself off and will not turn on until I plug the cord in. I can not use the wireless charging I bought with it to turn it on when this happens. It is not dead when it just shuts off. Please fix this issue."
4,,Love it I was looking for a cheaper but powerful tablet to have and I believe I found it. It has a black plastic but durable back with the Amazon logo on it. It's pretty light and really simple to set up. The quality of the screen is wonderful and bright but not bright enough to blind you. It's fast as responding to what you want and with the help of Alexa it's even faster. It's easy to figure out and work. The sound quality is WONDERFUL and the touchscreen is sensetive so be careful. It charges pretty fast and last a while. The only things I don't like about it is it's a fingerprint and smear magnet. It attracts them like crazy and that the camera quality is not the best. Other then that it's perfect,,,

6,,,,"Misleading Screenshots A) Is Amazon Echo able to be used between Europe and US?It was not clear from the Web page if an echo show would work and some said it would not between Europe and the US. So I bought a tablet.B) The advertised picture shows skype, but it is not preinstalled.I bought this for my 80-year-old mother in Europe. However, the pictures display that skype is installed. For exactly this reason I bought it. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT. I had to buy a second tablet for myself so I could talk her through installing skype while we both did the same installation sequence, I in the US she in Europe while we used a phone.After a long time, I managed finally to install skype with her remotely. We now leave the tablet alone and she only uses it for skype.C) Getting easily a device with advertisement disabled.The other really bad thing is that in Europe a device without an advertisement takes two months to be delivered when I tried ordering it from within Europe.In summary:It is a shame that Amazon makes this so difficult to disable advertisements, does not properly explain their video conferencing services, and has skype not preinstalled. It would be wonderful if we as customers could know a list of all preinstalled apps instead of showing us an advertisement that shows apps that are simply not installed. Would I have known all of this I would have gone for another Android tablet, or an iPad with facetime preinstalled. Especially as they do not have advertisements. Would I know if Echo Show would work between Europe and US (and has no adds) I would have bought that.  With COVID all over the place, having the ability to have a device for the elderly that is more straight forward to set up should be a priority for Amazon. This includes video conferencing and disabling ads.I hope others with parents that need a device for communication chose a device that is easier to set up or Amazon puts more effort in making it easier for elderly.",
7,"Greatly improved over my previous Kindle, but so much smaller! I like my new Kindle Fire 8 Plus and already see great improvements with more stable/reliable connectivity to WiFi, better battery life, and the docking station for charging is great. However, I didn't realize/expect the screen to be so much smaller than my Kindle Fire 7! Pros and Cons - it's lighter and small, easier to carry and handle while watching in bed, etc. Cons - smaller screen...but the resolution is better on the newer, smaller screen. In retrospect, I wish I'd paid more attention to screen size and considered a larger screen model. Otherwise, I'm a happy Kindle camper.",,,,
8,,Great product for the price!!! Love everything about my tablet except it’s a little bit slow; but for the buck; it gives a superb bang!!!,,,
9,,"Much smaller than I thought but great for recipes I really like this tablet. I bought it to use in the kitchen when I cook and want to follow a recipe I pinned on Pinterest. I also use this tablet to follow workouts on Peloton. I have a spin bike that has a space for a tablet so the tablet fits perfect on the holder. The battery life in the tablet is also fantastic. I charge every few days, less if I don’t use daily. I purchased with Ads and they only pop up when the tablet wakes up from sleep mode. It definitely does not bother me or interrupt my use of tablet.",,,
0,,"Excellent Value, Works Great Delivery was timely and correct.  Getting the tablet up and running was quick and easy.  Got a real nice case for free with the voucher that came with it.  The screen is big enough, clear enough, and colors are good enough for me to do just about anything from web surfing, to shopping, to watching movies, to playing chess.  The sound is good enough for hifi music listening through a set of good headphones or good speaker(s).  The touch screen responds fast.  The Fire HD 8 Plus has plenty of storage and ram, and the battery life is good.  I can't really think of anything bad to say about this tablet, so far.",,,
1,,,Decent Kindle but Disappointed I'm disappointed at how slow this tablet is. It doesn't seem any faster than my OLD HDX. I bought the Kindle HD 8 PLUS because it was supposed to be faster etc etc. Very disappointed. I don't know if I got a lemon or what.,,
2,"Great Overall but needs Screen Upgrade Let me just say that I have been using a 7"" Kindle Fire HDX which is getting old and out of date. I have not upgraded it because of the great screen resolution on the HDX.Finally, I decided to get the 8"" Kindle Fire HD Plus which has up to date operating system and more storage and wireless charging. I knew that the screen resolution was not up to the HDX but I got 8"" HD Plus. It works great but I miss the HDX screen.I wish that Amazon would upgrade the HD Plus screen to the HDX resolution. They would have a winner.",,,,

It goes on discount frequently, and if you have older fire, you'd get 20% off. Secondly, it's fast enough for most apps. I use the tablet mainly for my couch computing needs. I can read the news, books, listen to podcasts, do some home shopping and occassionaly play casual games or watch youtube. It's not as smooth as fast as an iPad. But keep in mind this thing is less than 1/3 the price of one. I upgraded from Fire 8 (2018), the performance on this thing is night and day.",,,

Because the Amazon application is available for IPhone I can sync colander, lists, and reminders to my IPhone I also own the latest IPad Pro, my main tablet, but do use thee Fire HD 8 plus a lot.

The primary use is reading ebooks, and I am quite happy with the Kindle software, which I use on my phone, on my laptop, and now on the upgraded tablet.  I am happy with the software that is available from Amazon, but I plan to add the Play Store option in the coming weeks.  Even without it, the Amazon software works just fine to meet my needs. I just recently purchased the upgrade, so I'll add more comments in a few months.  But right now I am very happy with the purchase.",,,

The.picture and sound is very good while watching videos, and playing games is very smooth and the new game mode is nice to have and works well.  It also does a good job browsing the web using Facebook or emails .  Alexa works great, and it's fine for music and audiobooks and reading.

4,"Not bad, but not spectacular either. Not bad, but not spectacular. Processor and wifi are a bit iffy at times. Amazon needs to dump Fire OS or offer a vanilla android version, although there are easy workarounds to get the Play store and other goodies on it. Screen is 720p, but nice quality. Speakers are surprisingly good. Nice even bezels all around, which I like. I also like that it doesn't have a metal body, nothing wrong with the plastic (feels a bit like the classic Nexus 7, which I also liked) and it makes it lightweight. Stadia and Geforce work ok, but spotty at times. Videos look and sound great.",,,,

There are a few issues, since it uses a 32 bit processor many sideloaded apps will not work and if you install the play store will not even show up. I kinda wish the screen was a little better but as is it’s totally useable. The battery life is great so no issues on that.

I'll occasionally even hear the noise it makes when it turns on and sure enough it is. Since I live alone I know someone else is not doing it.Also when I paid for no adds that's what I wanted. Not a lot of junk Amazon wants me to buy. I makes it very slow getting to what I want when I have to wait until all the things I don't want to clutter up the front page.I want the hdx back.

I purchased the 10"" but decided to upgrade to an 8"" hd + because the smaller size is easier for me to handle and I wanted the increased speed and storage.  I am very very disappointed.  It is slow and bogs down easily.  The majority of the apps I've used for years won't load because they dropped Google play.  My personal notes, design apps, recipe book app, books I'd downloaded not from amazon and games wouldn't cross over.  Books I have read that were still in my kindle library were marked as NEW so I had to individually reload my books only to find I'd already read them.  Now,  the title appears but I have to double tap and wait for the download everytime.  I cant just open and read.  Very annoying.  I use text to speech a lot.  EVERY time some add or notification arrives, the text to speech function shuts off.  So i have to open the kindle and restart the app.  Not great when I'm driving and listening to a book.  I must say I certainly didn't have these problems when I bought the 10"", before the new fire updates.  I would NOT recommend purchasing the new and improved version of the kindle fire HD+.  Get an old version or a different tablet all together."

I took the plunge when the Fire 8 HD plus was on special. I haven't had a chance to use all of the features, but I can see it's much faster. With an added memory card, I think it will be all I need to take advantage of the ebooks, games, and videos offered by Prime.

This is my third Kindle and this one has far more bells and whistles than earlier editions.  It is larger, has a brighter screen and I just can't say enough good things about it.  It still amazes me that I have hundreds of books stored on a product that is smaller than most hardbound books.  Plus other benefits like Kindle Unlimited make this a perfect gift for any reader.  Maybe Amazon can get the young people back into books again.",,,

5,,Previous charger plugs do not fit. Love the clarity & speed of touch screen . This replaces my previous Amazon Fire because it became painfully slow & wouldn’t hold a charge. We love Fire tablets for evening reading in low light. Really wish there was a Non-Reflective screen available for outdoor reading however!Disappointed that I can only charge in 1 location: on the new stand we purchased with the new tablet. This is our 6th tablet between hubby & me. (Our current plugs don’t fit this new model.) Be careful choosing a cover for stand up charging. ( Cover is mandatory since tablet is so slippery you can’t hold it!),,,

As soon as I take out of the docking station, it reverts to just a tablet, not Alexa. 3 meg of Ram, 64 gig internal memory, 64 gig external.  Alot of memory to play with.

I traded the 10 inch fire tablet in because of its size I never used it. The sound is about the same as my 10 inch.I do have an iPad but will be flying and an 8inch is much better for traveling as it will fit in my purse with books and my music downloaded.I did order the one with more memory and it moves much better.I now wait for a cheaper 1 TB SDCard to come in the market.,,,

I have no idea what's the problem.Secondly, on the homepage, what used to be the cover art icons  are now ghost boxes that nobody, including Amazon customer service or Amazon forum know how to get rid of; or should I say know how to get rid of easily. Once I found the forum (which wasn't easy at all) seems there is a rather involved fix that I have not yet tried. So far the best thing about this new Kindle is the battery life: its far exceeds what I experienced with the other two.  I'm hopeful that the next software upgrade will fix all the bugginess.",,

5,,"Fantastic tablet for the price. This is my second fire 8. I'm still using the first one, but the battery was starting to require charging more than once per day.This new one is considerably faster and accepts a larger, faster memory card. The only drawback is that the Fire OS does not allow the full variety of apps that an unmodified Android system allows, but the limitation aren't that bad and is a small price to pay for a powerful tablet at less than half the price of comparable units by other manufacturers.All in all, I am quite happy with it and will likely buy a third Fire in 4 or 5 years, when the battery begins to go on this one.",,,
6,,Fantastic tablet! This tablet is great for reading or watching movies. I love that I can download my favorite streaming apps  and switch to watching movies when I'm between books.

7,,,"Wanted to Love it, but FireOS is Awful So overall this is a decent tablet hardware wise for the price.  I appreciated the USB-C connector and the wireless charging, although I didn't expect to use the wireless charging.  The screen quality is pretty bad though.  I could have lived with the screen if not for the operating system.  As an android user for a long time, I thought FireOS would be similar enough and I would be able to work around it.  Not so much.  I ended up returning the Fire 8HD+ and getting the Lenovo Smart Tab M8 for $99.00.  The Tab M8 is way better in my opinion.  Granted it doesn't have USB-C (micro instead), or wireless charging, but it does have a much better screen, although it is the same resolution as the Fire.  I liked the M8 I bought for the kids so much I ended up finally replacing my trusty Nexus 7 with the M8 FHD version that is $120.00.So long story short, decent hardware, but if you prefer a true Android operating system,  you can find better tablets for similar price.",,

I upgraded from Fire gen. 3 to gen. 10 this is better and very fast if you compare the two generations of Kindle fires  .

3,"Read before buying If you are looking for a true tablet experience this is not the device you are looking for. The App Store is of Amazon’s own design (a pale shadow of the GooglePlay/Apple stores) and does not include many popular apps like Etsy. Basically, any business with an app that is in direct competition with Amazon is not available on a Fire Tablet. However is you are all in with Amazon and are not interested in all the other stuff, go nuts. It’s cheap, the screen is great, and it’s speedy for the price.",,,,
4,"I'd buy it again Great value for your money. Although everything is attached to Amazon and your Amazon account. It's still a great divide, my child loves to play games, and husband likes the music app. I'm into the movies and shopping on Amazon apps. Screen quality could be better, it tends to dim and then brighten. Also camera quality isn't really great. Took birthday photos some came out fuzzy and blurred. Over all worth its value. Wish it had Google play, I miss some of my favorite apps.",,,,
5,"Could be better The best thing about this is a much better battery compared to an older model. What I do like is a much faster load after a selection is made and the crisp clear screen. The unit also charges much faster than older models. What I do not like is when auto brightness is selected the brightness changes too much, very distracting when reading. For some reason the KF emits a tone for no reason or at least a reason I have not discovered. OverI would give this unit a B+,the unit is recommended and I would purchase again.",,,,

I have used two Fire HD 8s and a Fire HD 10 almost to the point of where one would expect their life span to end.I recently bought two new HD 8 pluses and a wireless docking station . My intent was to use the Show Mode with the docking station primarily to display the time and weather. The HD 8 plus itself is great, but the Show Mode is not.Show Mode displays the time and weather just fine and responds to requests to Alexa as expected. However, there is a constant recirculating banner at the bottom suggesting "" try, ""Alexa,....."""". In effect, Show Mode is one continuous promotion for Alexa. This cannot be turned off.  Why would anyone want a product that constantly advertises itself?I do like the wireless charging, but the dock itself has a cord that must be plugged in. Not sure yet if I will return the docking station.",,

0,,,"Familiar to predecessor and not in a good way I replaced a first gen Fire 7 that was sitting in a drawer for 2-3 years.  There were some improvements to speed and the screen but I felt like the HD 8 was all too familiar and not in a good way. What this platform needs is a major UI update.  I have a Recast and I there is no Live option like the FireTV has. In fact the firetv app doesn’t even communicate to the Recast ( guess what,  my iPhone and IPad have no problems).  The fire tv stick seems much more refined.  I’ve heard that Amazon devices are great delivery items for Amazon media but I would challenge that idea.  I find it clunky to search magazines and books if you’re looking to search only for AmazonUnlimited content.  Not a fire tablet problem, but AmazonUnlimited content is often no better than a blog complete with spelling errors.  We use this tablet in Show mode on a wireless charger dock and the Show performance seemingly randomly cycles from black screen to black screen with clock to making Alexa suggestions.  I haven’t figured it out.",,
1,,"This is the best fire yet! I have owned several fire tablets over the years and this is much the best of the crop. I bought it with the 64mgb option and added a 256mb micro card so I can load several books at once. It loads fast, but needs to have a lot of battery power to load. I especially like the feature that shows you all the books in a series in order. I do not like the dashboard because it keeps popping up and has to be gotten rid of before you can do what you wanted to do. The battery charges faster, and gives enough energy to last all day and maybe two and I read a lot!",,,
2,"Upgraded from HD8 7th Gen I was very happy with my older 7th gen HD8. The handling was excellent. But when I open the newest HD8+, I honestly a bit of disappointed. I didn’t aware that the screen ratio was changed. It feel a bit smaller and weird to read. This is the only reason I decided to return. Maybe I should hope for HD10+. Pro side, the touch screen feel more responsive, and the boot speed is faster. And like some other reviews mentioned, the new location of the camera is a nice touch. With most the kids now study from home with online meetings, the new design makes some sense.",,,,

Amazon offered a trade-in program so, I felt this was an appropriate way to discard of old screens/batteries, whatever. I printed the mailing labels, packaged the tablets and sent them off. One of the two tablets I returned was an early Kindle, so I didn't really expect anything in return for it. Just a chance to discard it appropriately.After a couple of weeks, I'm informed the old Kindle was rejected and would be returned to me.(?????) A few days later I received someone else's old Kindle that was beaten-up and dead as a door nail. The old Kindle I returned was fully functioning....it was just old.So.....did Amazon mix up returned Kindle tablets? I want my old/old tablet back (I guess) not someone else's that won't recharge!!!

9,,,,"Not as good as G7 I had a Fire HD8 (Generation 7) for over four years before the touch screen simply stopped responding.  I bought this Fire HD8 (Generation 10) to replace it.What I like:* It's a Kindle.  I wanted to read books and be able to search on the internet and make purchases from Amazon.  I can do all that.* Price was good.What I dislike (compared to Generation 7):* The power button has been moved from the upper right side of the unit toward the left side - next to the volume control.  I frequently push the wrong button (power when I want volume and vice versa) and often end up with my volume at an unexpected level.* The volume button is counterintuitive for me.  I turn the volume down when I want it to go up, up when I want it to turn it down.* It sends out noisy notifications during the night.  Adjusting the volume of notifications ends up not ""sticking"" (most likely because at some point I've pushed the volume button instead of the power button).* There's another symbol (in addition to ""go back"", ""return home"", and ""switch between apps"") in the navigation bar.  It's not mentioned in the instructions provided with my Kindle.  What I do know is that it is positioned right where I hold my Kindle when I'm reading.  While reading, my book will suddenly disappear and the Device Dashboard appears where some ""caterpillar dots"" tell me it's looking for something that it never finds.Overall it does what I want, but I'm of an age where adjusting to the differences is just so - ugh.",

Amazon should have given it an octa-core processor. The better processor would have made sense with 3gb of ram.

7,,"Extremely handy for the price This is a great little device for the price. It's not blazing fast but very comfortable to use. I use it for reading mainly, but I have a few apps on there and it can manage running them at the same time. Sometimes it is a little slow, but not to the point where it makes for a bad experience.If you are planning on doing any serious gaming on it, it's probably going to disappoint. But if you're looking for a little device that you can hold for a long time without it weighing down your hand, watch videos, do some reading, check social apps, it should work fine. Plus, for the price, it's hard to beat the 3GB of RAM.",,,
8,,"2 in 1 Entertainment Gadget and Smart Device Controller I’ve used my first gen fire tablet to watch movies and read books when I travel for work. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, I haven’t been using my first gen fire tablet because I haven’t had any business trips since then.I replaced my older fire tablet with this Fire 8+ because of the docking station that can convert this into an “echo show.” So now I can control my smart devices at home.This serves some of my needs (like watching movies and reading books and controlling my smart devices); plus I don’t have to buy an echo show. However this cannot replace some of the things that I do with my iPad (photo management in adobe lightroom, Photoshop, quick video edits in iMovie and GoPro Quik, etc).",,,

This happened with the last update and I am not a fan.  I don't use it for any games or other apps other than the Amazon shopping app, so I really miss the old format!!",,,,
2,"Love the beefed up Fire. So far, I like everything about my new Fire tablet. However, I was very surprised to find that the cords from my other Kindles do not fit the new Fire.  I use my tablet in my car, upstairs and downstairs in my home.  I have charging cords in all these places and now I am unable to use them.  Granted the battery life is better in the new Fire, but that does not outweigh the convenience I find in being able to plug in my Kindle wherever I am whenever I need to.",,,,

I was very disappointed to fin out nighter one were available  It seems to me it is just platform to sell other TV services.  I have a lot of streaming services mostly all British. It bugged me to know I could not get them. I called customer service twice and they were unsuccessful at helping set it up. I couldn't even get the App for The Prime video app. I think I will send it back. I had to change my password 3 times.,,,

I am satisfied with it so much so, that I just ordered another one for my husband for his birthday.  This Fire is just what I had hoped for, it is fast and pretty much user friendly.  I read a lot and the upgrade to 64 gb holds all of my library form the past and still has tons of room for more.  I also have the charging station which is wonderful.  I just set the book on it and walk away.",,,

However...I do not like where the power button was placed, as it's right next to the volume up/down buttons. I am constantly turning off my tablet when trying to adjust volume. I did not purchase the wireless charging station, and I do not use my tablet for all the options that most people use it for, but I do like almost everything else about this tablet.",,,,

A little bit bigger, but lighter and thinner, and pulled up everything within seconds - I didn’t have to do anything! Even the formatting in the e-books has improved (I have “3 minutes left in this chapter”) and I can access everything I need easily. This was a much needed change, and I was happy to see that I didn’t have a huge learning curve in going from such an old version. I decided to upgrade (finally) when my old Kindle was taking almost 8 hours to fully charge. The Kindle 8+ is fully charged in under an hour. Love it!",,,

I purchased my first Kindle over 5 years ago and although it still works great, I felt like a needed an updated version.  The camera takes great pictures and will even download photos from my phone.  Since I already had books and music on my other Kindle everything downloaded without me doing anything.  The sound is excellent and the display is really nice.  I use it mostly for my music and books.  It comes with Alexa so I am looking forward to giving that a try.  It also comes with expandable storage which my first Kindle did not have.

6,,,"GONE TOO SOON... I've had to purchase tablets twice in the past year because of how easily Kindle Fire damage is--especially with kids involved! I got the cases, but it didn't matter, and a mere 3 seconds of water exposure was enough to drown this latest one. My students managed to kill both brand new Kindle Fire products, the last one costing me $120 for less than six months of use. So, now we'll go without any tablets in the classroom. Seriously, Amazon, you can conquer the commercial world from what started as an online book store, but you can't manage to produce a warhorse or just a basic device for reading books that will stand up to brief exposure to water?!?!? We're not talking a river or ocean, just a couple of seconds back at the sink where kiddos had to wash hands before device use to cut down on corona exposure. For shame on my pocketbook!",,
7,,Great value for the cost I mainly use this Kindle for a game that takes quite a bit of memory. That is the main reason I purchased it. I have small hands and I was concerned that the tablet would be too heavy but I have no problem. The machine is easy to maneuver and use. I like that the tablet was easy to set up initially and is fast. We live in a remote area where speed can be an issue. I have no complaints. I did notice that this machine has a different charger USB than my other Kindles in the past. It uses a USB C so not all connectors will work with this machine. A short cord charger is sent with this Kindle.,,,
8,Like my purchase Good products,,,,

I splurged on the Fire DB 8 Plus.  I would give it an overall 5 star rating except for the fact that I needed to contact customer service twice in two days. First because most of the book thumbnails in Kindle were just blank black boxes and after that was resolved I was not able to download any of our books to the Fire. Both times customer service was very helpful and helped fix the issues quickly. Just not sure why a Fire that was only a month old and had only been used to read a couple of books should run into these kinds of problems. Again, other than that, and thanks to Amazon customer service, I will say I am please with my new Fire.",,

1,,Much more expensive but worth it if you keep these for years I had a fire seven for years and could no longer charge it. I went through the fire +8 after a bad experience with the new E reader and it’s a promise of a longer battery life. The fire eight is has a larger screen better battery life and can do more things. Price is significantly higher but I find it to be worth it because I keep these fires for years. I really like the touch charge aspect and did buy the charger. The case on it fits well. Total cost was about $240 for the case the charger and the 8.0 HD Plus.,,,

The next, a an 8 in, was quite basic, seemed cheap, slow, limited battery life, narrow.  My new 8 plus is more like the 8.9.  I like it!  Noticeably faster, better colors, more substantial feeling. The case is easy to hold. I recommend the 8 Plus HD Fire. Only reason didn't give it 5 stars, it doesn't have Google Play Store for apps.  It can be side loaded, but that always makes me nervous.",,,,

They are Six Dice and dice match. So I play with them on my phone which has a higher resolution. The battery is pretty good, depending on if you are using WiFi.

Like the old one, you have to hold the button down until it responds, then you have to wait for it to power up and load your apps.  I don't play video games, just games like solitaire so I can't speak to the speed for those kind of games.  But for what I do, I could have saved my money and kept the old one.",,,,

The 8 inch size is nice and the keyboard is better than even the larger phones.  All in all I found it as advertised and I REALLY like the charging stand that I purchased to go with it!.  Just lay the kindle on it at night and never have to worry with charging it otherwise. (Makes a good night light/clock).,,,

My iPad Pro is too large to be able to take with me everyday without having to worry the screen make get scratched or cracked.  The size of the Fire HD8 is perfect.  I can hold kit in one hand and read the screen comfortably.  The screen resolution is nice.  Once you get used to the OS, you appreciate it for what it is.  It’s great for shopping on Amazon which is handy during this pandemic.  I also have the wireless charging stand and love that the Fire HD8 can also act like my Echo Show.  It’s a fantastic bedside addition.",,,
5,,"Acts like an Echo Show 8 I haven't used it yet.  I bought it for my GF who has an older 8.9 HDX.  I don't think any of the newer tablets can match the HDX for processor power or screen resolution.  But the battery is wearing out.  So I bought the new HD 8 for her to use while I work on the HDX, since I have never done that before.  But she never lets it go so the HD 8 sits in its charging station acting like an echo show.  Of course, it doesn't have the speakers that an echo show 8 does.  I think it will be a nice little tablet.",,,

My old Kindle Fire, well, it was about to give up the ghost (to my utter dismay), with the battery dying at 40% at times and I kept running out of storage, 'cause audiobooks! And, well, I hoard books. Anyway, I bought the Fire HD 8 and just WOW! I'm so freaking impressed. The quality is over the top. And the battery life? Insane! It's longer than listed. I've listened to full audiobooks, read, and streamed Netflix without it dying--over a period of days. Seriously, if you want an amazing Kindle, I highly recommend the Fire HD 8.

Having said that, it gets stuck if i try going back and forth even within the same app. But at this price point, i have to be realistic and not have high expectations. If you want to just check your emails or other simple tasks, this works fine. The battery lasts a long time which is important.",,

Good bang for $55+taxes, but I wouldn't' pay more for this. I got it mainly to wirelessly control a digital audio mixer, so I guess that's all it is for.

And there’s nothing wrong with that I knew at this price point that it wouldn’t be comparable to an iPad Pro or a galaxy tab S6 but I’m truly amazed at how well it performs. Especially at its price bracket, I picked one of these up on sale and said hey why not. It helps bridge the gap between my phone and my other media devices. Don’t regret the purchase at all. The HD plus is a huge improvement over last gen. (While the New HD8 is a decent improvement.) it does what it needs too and who can complain when it’s nearly $100 🤷🏻‍♂️👌🏼",,,

This new one I put in one of those magnetic devices so I no longer have to plug in and out to charge.

(I sometimes read 4 at a time)This new Fire seems to have bugs!! And of course since I purchased it on August , now the return time has lapsed, this just makes me mad, I really should have bought a new I-Pad, but live and learn. I doubt anyone reads these, lets face it once bought you are on you own.Thank God I still have my I-Pad to find my books, can you guess I am NOT a happy camper!This Fire was cheaper than I-Pad, but what good if it freezes!Just know this FIRE is not hot, just maybe a door stop now!",,

There's a title page called for you, it's definitely not setup for you, its full of news ads powered from Microsoft News and no matter what you do you can not remove them, and its all the news channels I hate with no access to the ones I actually do watch. Doesn't seem to matter that we are the ones who paid a lot of money for this thing they still have taken upon themselves to make these decisions for you.If there is a reason for all these ads to be on here, (which why they would all have to be news makes no sense) but anyway, if I'm not understanding then at least give the option to hide them from view OR give every single news channel out there instead of just the ones you deem worthy!Needless to say I liked the older version I had better, at least you felt like once you bought it that it was actually yours to decide what apps etc. you wanted on it and much easier to get around in.No I do not recommend this, again not for performance but just because of the things I mentioned!"

The plastic backplate on this tablet is quite smooth and slippery (unlike some tablets, which have a rubberized backside to improve grip).I don't mind the home screen ads too much considering the cheap/subsidized price of the device, but I don't own a dog, Amazon.

5,,Well worth the money Overall improvement over earlier model. Especially pleased with the speed and battery life of the unit.

I've paid extra for no ads, yet I can't turn off this junk that I'm not interested in.  I feel like I'm being constantly spammed and I really have developed a dislike for this particular kindle.If they can't fix this mess in next version I'll be upgrading to an ipad.  I'd rather pay more and not have to deal with this poorly designed and junked up with ads kindle."

I wanted an 8 as it is lighter but needed more space and update since my last one was about five years old (still works fine but battery is no longer good).  This morning, I had a chat with the support team.  My 'clear all' button had disappeared and had too many screens open.  I called as I could not find anywhere online where I could repair it myself.  The first of four techs told me to do a factory reset after rebooting, restarting and clearing the caches didn't work.  I did not want to do that because of the hassle of starting all over and this is where I am right now.  Hours later, I still do not have my kindle like it was before I called.  When the first tech couldn't help, he was 'disconnected'.  Okay that happens, the second couldn't help me she was disconnected.  Okay that is an odd coincidence.  The third one told me that I have no warranty...that kindles are only warranted for THREE MONTHS!!!!  I have looked and still have not found that documented anywhere.  By the fourth tech, I disconnected them.  Am I saying don't buy a kindle, no.  But  wanted all to be aware that there is virtually no warranty on them and support sucks.  While I was trying to put everything back on with all the open windows, I did find that with one of the upgrades, they moved the clear all button from the top of the screen to the far left, out of sight.  So, it still works but now I have absolutely none of the apps I had, I only have what went into the cloud which is not much.",
8,,Perfect for me I use it primarily for reading downloaded books and the occasional web surf-size is nice for keeping beside bed and battery life seems very good as well. Pleased with the purchase...especially the price!,,,
9,"Great purchase I’m really pleased with this purchase. I especially love the wireless charging! It goes into game mode when I play games, which is great and I can control that if I want to. The only negative is the power button is in a place that can easily be pushed by accident. I’ve turned it off accidentally several times. I just have to learn to be aware of that. Otherwise this is a great device.",,,,
0,,Love my Kindle I loved my old Kindle and love this one. My main interest is reading on them. I have aging eyes and Kindle has helped me to continue reading.The only negative for me is that they moved the power button left of center and I am so used to clicking it with my right finger as I opened the old one. But I will get used to the change.I really like the wireless charging. I bought a dock a few years ago at Costco for our Samsung S9 and S9+. The Kindle connects to it perfectly as long as I flip it to landscape position.,,,
1,,"Easy to use! I like this tablet a lot. The touch screen took some getting used to but once I was able to adjust the sensitivity I was all set. It's user friendly and I love how easy to use, lightweight, and portable it is.",,,
2,,"4th one I’ve bought Love my Fire Hd tablet for game playing. I’m ready to retire and wanted something with very good resolution and multi functional. This is it! Works for me, have used it every day since it arrived.",,,
3,,Solid tablet at a great price Put together nice . Only complaint not with tablet . But wireless charging should be easier and they should be more wireless chargers available,,,
4,,"Biased, but love it I've been a kindle owner since they very first came out and they get better and better! This one has great sound and color and easy access to all the stuff I use, tons of GBs for downloading books, shows, movies, music. The game changer tho is the wireless charger that it is compatible with. The charging port is the 1st thing to get all loose and  jacked up on any device, so to bypass that completely, will lengthen the life of my device, I'm sure. I can't think of one bad thing to say!",,,
5,,Works great! I didn't have to charge it for 4 days now and I'm still at 67% battery.  I would recommend to everyone,,,
6,"This is my 4th Fire tablet I am always happy with the Kindle Fire Tablet...my only complaint is the length of the charging cord. Please let me know if it is possible to get a longer cord or point me to the one that is best to purchase. All in all, I love this device. This is my 4th because I listen to audiobooks approximately 20 hours a day.  Helps me sleep.",,,,
7,,"So light and sharp....but so many books!!!! I use mine for books...even though I said I would never do it. Yes I do love the feel and smell of a book, but I love the portability of a bunch without the weight.Plus, I literally can get a ton of books anywhere that has wifi. Love it.",,,
8,,,Good but not Great I like it because it reads me audio books. That's what I primarily use it for. I also use the Zoom app for video conferencing and that works pretty well.Some of the apps are incredibly glitchy though. I will suddenly get 100+ Facebook messenger notifications that were sent over the last few days. Or I will delete all wake up alarms and somehow it still goes off the next morning. Navigating the home screen is a bit tricky too. Sometimes it freezes or takes a few seconds to load and by then you've accidentally clicked a random link and you have to wait for that to load too. I like that alexa is built into it. I got it on prime day on sale. I do not feel like it's worth it at full price but on sale its decent.,,
9,,,"My 5th Kindle Fire is a disappointment I have gone through 5 Kindle Fire tablets. I use my Kindle Fire everyday - all day.  After about 2 years the batteries no longer charge.  I accept that because I can say I get my money's worth for those two years.  When I received the All-new Fire HD 8 Plus tablet the first thing that I noticed was that is used a C charging wire.  That meant that none of the wires I have accumulated (you know, one for each room, sized specifically for where I am using/charging the device) would work.  I purchased additional wires.  That was annoying.  But what really makes no sense to me was moving the on/off button so close to the volume control buttons so that I am constantly shutting off the device while I'm watching something when I only want to raise or lower the volume.  Terrible design.Yes, the picture is good.  But then all my Fires had a beautiful picture. I'm just terribly disappointed with the changes.",,
0,"This is my 5th kindle and find the same problem... I have had 5 different Kindles over time but this kindle when reading to me cuts out at various times. It just stops reading. I have to turn it on and start it up again. The last one I had started doing the same thing and I thought it was just time to get a new kindle but nope, this one does the exact same thing. I have read that many people have the same problem that has not been able to be fixed. I sms disappointed with that.",,,,
1,,"Good tablet for all I got this for a family tablet since you can do adult and kids profiles on it. I love it. The screen quality is great for the price, not pixelated or ""low quality"" (it's better than my Samsung s9). We bout the docking system so it can be used in the show mode and not drain battery fast but surprisingly the battery lasts long. I haven't had any issues with the touch screen; not too sensitive but also you don't have to press down hard. We have a protective case on it and it will charge on the wireless docking system in the case.",,,
2,"Big improvements over previous models.  Except for one annoying addition. So much faster than my last Kindle Fire.  Boots up quickly. Battery life seems great.  Would have given it 5 stars, but there is no way to turn off or turn down the sound it makes when you turn it on.  Very loud alert type sound.  Not good when wanting to turn it on in bed and not possibly wake up my sleeping wife.  Other than that, a great improvement over past models.",,,,
3,,Perfect!! Really great product. This is my 4th different generation of the fire tablet. Keeps getting better.,,,
4,,battery life It's great for travel.,,,
5,,"Much more than I expected. Annoying ads. But only on swiping the lock screen. That being said I would have opted for the non ad unit for $20 more. The dock is wonderful. This is the best tablet I have seen to date. Decent construction. The camera is wimpy but it does video calls well and Who takes pictures with a tablet anyway. Great entertainment options. Easily d/l Google apps. You will want Chrome for your browser as the Amazon ""silk"" browser is not very good. I really can't recommend this enough. Its everything I wanted and much more. Last note get the  3mb plus. Its faster and better when running multiple programs.",,,
6,"It's convenient I have trouble with Kindle. I get emails about free books from prime membership and from kindle. Isnt it all the same?Also I hot an email to store all my pictures on Amazon photo so I did it but only stores on my phone. None are on the tablet, where I want them. If I cant do that, no sense keeping on my phone. Also stored in Google and Samsung",,,,
7,Good for reading books. Convenient for book purchases and surfing the net.,,,,
8,,Great My little one loves it.I can't keep him off it.Great tool for bribing kids into doing their chores.I'm happy with this tablet.Just gotta figure out how to make the parental controls do their job. I set screen times and off times and my kid still uses it after hours.,,,
9,,"Ready to argue with customer service? I purchased the Fire HD 8 Tablet with the.wireless charger bundle. I LOVE the product...good visibility, charges quickly, small enough to fit in small purse. It was supposed to come with 6 months of Kindle Unlimited. I have now chatted with 4 different customer service reps who don't believe me that I am to receive the subscription with this purchase. Frustrating to say the least! I will keep pursuing since that was one of the reasons I purchased the bundle. Also be aware that some apps I was used to are not available because this product is not supported by Google Play. Overall though very satisfied with the product itself.",,,
0,,"Just what I needed at the right price. I traded in my 2017 Fire HD8 for the 2020 Fire HD8 Plus. I hated the 2017 because it was sooo slooow. I never used it and stuck with my iPad Mini. I like the small footprint of 8 in tablets and I like Android, so I thought I'd give the new Fire a chance. Big difference - the speed is the same as my iPad. The drawback is that Google playstore is absent. Apps I needed for my smart home are not available  in the Amazon store. I did the work-around to get google playstore and now have a decent 8in tablet without paying a high price. Just hope it all sticks, if there is an update of the tablet.",,,

2,,I love it I love it,,,
3,,"Love this Fire/kindle! I have owned a much older Fire tablet (HDX). It was a great tablet that was used for so many years the battery no longer held power.  Saying all that- this new Fire Tablet surprised me on ease of use, the amount of books, movies, songs, and audibles that can be kept in memory when traveling. I paid for extra memory and the TB memory card.  Well worth the purchase.  I have owned many Apple iPads and this Fire Tablet is now my new favorite.My only wish was that this was waterproof like the new Kindle.I am extremely happy with this purchase.",,,
4,"Some great features but some quibbles Much to like with a faster processor, more RAM and set-up to use in landscape mode.  It works in show mode when on the charger.My quibbles are that the on/off button was moved up to the middle of the right side of the tablet from the easily accessed button on the lower right side corner of the tablet.  After several years of using the prior iteration, this change gets me on a daily basis.",,,,
5,,"Entertaining Tablet I enjoy using it. Good for browsing the internet, watching things like Youtube, and Pluto tv app. Storage is bigger than Fire 7. Battery last longer too. I would recommend this tablet for people who are on a budget.",,,
6,"Nice tablet This is a nice tablet but smaller than I thought it was going to be. I had the 8.9  2nd generation and liked that size better but this is a lighter tablet to hold.  I like that feature. I do not like the book section, it is too busy with recommendations and liked the older Kindle better. On the older model the screen just displayed the books you ordered but never read yet. This screen now is too busy.",,,,
7,,,"Great item with a little modification This item is ok out of the box. It depends on what you are going to use it for. It did not support the Peacock app and YouTube TV had to be watched via a web browser rather than the app. However, once modified to be able to access the Google App Store (several YouTube videos on how to fo this), it all works great and makes the tablet well worth the money.",,

9,,"A mighty little beast I love the speedy response of the 8 Plus. Unlike my older Fire 7, there is no noticeable lag time in loading apps or completing an action.The 12-hr battery claim does not seem to be accurate.",,,
0,Very similar to the previous version The main thing that I notice that is different is a slightly smaller size and the location of the power button.  The location of the power button makes it too easy to hit by accident.  I thought I would get used to it - but no.  I really loved my older one.,,,,

2,,Easy to use and set up The media could not be loaded.,,,
3,,,"A Decent Tablet But... This is a decent tablet but...It's kind of slowIt's highly geared toward Amazon everything (to be expected)There's a limited number of apps that you can add. No Google Playstore. I couldn't find the app for my home security system.In the Books section it rarely shows the covers/titles of the books in my library, only the stuff it wants me to buy. That makes it harder to open a book that I'm in the middle of to continue reading.The 2 news apps don't even list Fox News as an option for what news you want to see.As I mentioned in the specifics sections the screen is great, the battery is good. It's pretty easy to navigate. I've watched a little of a movie and it was good. If you're ok with the items mentioned in the ""but..."" section then this is a good tablet. If you want access to more then you're going to have to spend more and get another brand.",,

6,,"This is my 6th Kindle Out of 6 kindles, only one (my 5th I think) didn't last very long. One I traded in, but the others are still working. I usually use one or two for reading and the others for playing games. The battery in this last one lasts a long time between chargings. Also the connection cord is different from the others. The end that goes into the kindle is a little bigger. My one problem is that when I try to play one of my old games on a new kindle, all of my progress is lost.",,,
7,,,"Still nope If I don't like Fire Tablets, why do I keep buying them? Because they are cheap and have show mode. That's all. They suck otherwise. Even though this one is faster than my last, it is still anything but fast. Also, no Google, no Play Store. Which leaves me having to mess about in the settings and uploading files to install it myself. Just, give people a choice. I am still going to use Amazon products, but Google has somethings you don't, deal with it. Stop trying to control people.",,
8,Faster than my original Fire 8 I bought 2 to replace 2 Fire 8 that we had acquired quite a few years ago they are faster and am still getting used to the format. They are nice for the price although I do wish I could get adobe and weatherbug on them I wish they would keep the apps instead of switching them out for other it's very frustrating when you can get an app on one tablet but not the other.,,,,

I absolutely love the long battery life, and not have to constantly watch the battery level like I do on my old Kindle Fire.  I've gone for several days without re-charging, and finally last night I put it on charge even though it still had about 35% battery life left.  I personally don't see a problem with the USB C cord as opposed to a USB cord.  I do, however, wish that they would make the cords at least a couple of feet longer.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",,,

8,,"Kindle alternative My idea was to buy a kindle, but reading its reviews I opted for the Fire Tablet since price is much the same but with better processor and characteristics. Interface is pretty much the same as any tablet and speed is great for the price. The only drawbacks I think it has is it doesn't come with Google Play (although I get it... its Amazon's competitor and you can install it through 3rd party apps) and its a bit heavier than kindle for reading.I bought it to read books so it is just great for that.",,,
9,,,"Faster, but seems to be way more wifi issues than last gen I've had a Kindle Fire for probably the last 4 years, own a total of 7 of them, a few with cracked screens. I upgraded from the previous gen HD 8 due to the USB-C and hardware upgrades. It is more responsive and faster than my old one, but in the week-ish I've had this, I've had multiple WIFI issues, with it dropping the connection or showing weak connection strength.I can turn on my old kindle and have them sitting side by side, old version full WIFI, the Plus only showing 1 bar. I have 2 access points and 2.4 and 5 bands. I've tried both, resetting both access points. As all my other devices don't have an issue with the WIFI strength, I can only assume it's the 8 Plus.The 3 star is mainly because of the WFI, otherwise it's a solid 5. I don't regret the upgrade, as the few WIFI issues aren't critical and the extra speed and USB-C charging outweigh the hassles I've had. The less different cords I need the better.",,

The Kindle app is much improved over the original. She likes thePage Flip' and the 'About This Novel' features that were not in old Kindle app.Only negative is the plastic back is very smooth and was a bit hard for her to hold.

Wireless charging is an awesome feature that even the iPad does not have. Plenty of memory 64Gb. All Prime services are easily accessible. The reason for 4 stars is - there is no default security - there should be at least fingerprint authentication to get in. Also, the ads are obnoxious - they are constantly intrusive and can be annoying. Screen resolution can also be increased. I would certainly pay more to remedy these deficiencies.",,,,
4,,,,,"Not so happy as when I bought. Replaced a Lenovo tablet which was deteriorating.Pros:- Fire HD is fast, has a great screen, and excellent capacity.- Package seems fairly rugged.Cons:- The screen is not oleophobic, so benefits from frequent cleaning.- Kindle app can't be locked to one orientation, you must lock the screen instead.- Built-in speakers are underpowered.While it is a great value, this is my first Kindle with ads, and you must be careful how you swipe the screen to open, else you will get the offers instead of the home screen.UPDATE: Lowered my rating. The Kindle app on my Android phone is more pleasant. On Fire:- App must be killed and restarted if left idle for a few hours, as the side menu comes up empty.- Lack of orientation lock, as stated above, is annoying.- Bookmarks list and dictionary/Wikipedia windows now open as white on black; no setting I have found will change that.- Multiple books from one author are presented as a stack, so you click the stack for entry to the actual list of books. (Not on the Android app.)I remain happy with the performance, but one might expect that on the Fire tablet, the Kindle app would be the showpiece -- instead it seems to get little attention either for defects or for the user experience."
5,,"Definitely an upgrade over my six year old Fire I got this new Fire HD as a replacement for one that was approximately six years old.  The new one is definitely faster and has a good quality screen.  I primarily use the Fire as a reader with Kindle Unlimited.  The one thing I wish Amazon would fix with the Fire OS is the capability to quickly and easily close apps similar to how Android offer the ability to quickly close individual or all apps.  With Fire OS, you have to go into settings and then into apps/notifications and individually force apps to close which is really clunky especially since the settings don't show which apps are currently running.",,,

8,,,,,"Pony up the extra for a Kindle Paperwhite, HD10, or budget iPad or Samsung tab HD8 is definitely not a smaller form factor HD10, even the “Plus” variant. Fire tablets are no powerhouses, but the experience on the HD8+ was a downgrade compared to the HD10, which is the main device we let our kid use. Screen quality looked worst on the 8” vs the 10” (which shouldn’t be the case on a smaller screen with same HD resolution) and the processing of basic functions was noticeably slower. When trying to return it, I noticed that even Amazon doesn’t list the HD8+ on its trade-in menu. They really just want to clear out inventory and maybe discontinue it soon. I was able to do a straight exchange at its full value for a new Kindle Paperwhite on sale (just paid the difference). The 8+ was really just intended to be a glorified e-reader anyway so the Paperwhite is the way to go for that."

The screen is only on for 30 minutes at a time before it has to be reset (swiping/tapping).

I have to wake up the kindle, swipe the home screen, to reactivate the reading of it again. Occasionally, it is convenient, but I find it is more an annoyance than anything else.  I only use it as a PC when I travel, and I'm not doing that at this time (thank you COVID).",,
2,,Good product Got it for my daughter and she loves it!!,,,
3,,,"Controls have a mind of there own Good quality screen with great battery life.  Slow to switch apps, random menus appear on screen at odd times and they can be hard to remove.  The volume pops up the most and can be very diffcult tomakeit go away.  Very difficult to shut down for some odd reason.  Can take multiple attempts.",,

5,,"Excellent Value I bought it primarily as a book reader. But it is nice to have the extras afforded by it being a tablet as well. Nice size, excellent visual quality. Works very well - read 8 books on it so far and I'm really liking it. I also purchased the Amazon cover for it and I think that improves the ergonomics - and adds some protection. Without the cover, the tablet slides more on your lap if that is where you have it. The cover solves that problem. Also makes it easier to hold like a book. All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.",,,
6,"Nice little Kindle Fire I especially like the wireless charging. I have had issues with the charging ports on my other Kindles so this is a change. The only thing that is a problem for me is, I like to hold my Kindle in the horizontal position. This means that the on/off button, sound volume, and headphone jack end up right where my hands are. Several times, I have accidentally bumped then while trying to read or see. Other than that, this Kindle is really nice.",,,,
7,,"Excellent except..... The only minor issues I have are the position of the power switch and camera.  I usually use it in portrait mode with a charge cable that has a right angle connector.  That puts the power switch right under the wire/connector.  Also the camera position is great if you use it mostly landscape, but not so much in portrait.  In addition, if you have other kindles (like I do) you can no longer use the other chargers and cables, as this one uses a ""quick charge"" charger with a type C connector.  My phone uses a ""quick charge"" charger with a type C connecter so I already have extras. Other than that its great.",,,
8,,Package Delivery I purchase a Fire HD8 Plus for my wife to replace her older version which stopped working.  I arrived today but was not left on either my side porch or front pouch but instead left on  bags of mulch in front of my porch where anyone could have walked off with it.  As I am expecting my own new reader tomorrow I would hope it is place on the side pouch  (preferred location) or  on the front porch.,,,
9,,,,"People, don't buy this crap!  Amazon garbage they don't support.  Not worth the money! I wanted to like this tablet given the price, but alas after a few months I'm finding you get what you pay for.  Amazing the only thing that works well and fast is streaming TV and Movies.  Music and all other apps are slow, slow, slow.  Probably the worst thing is the Silk Internet browser.  What a piece of garbage!  Slow to open, slow to search, slow to open links, despite clearing history and cache dozens of times a day and re-starting or rebooting just to get the internet search features to work for a little while.  I've tried support and all the internet ""hacks"", and still spend way too much time clearing cache, history, and re-starting.  Seems like every day the performance of this tablet degrades more making one wonder if the seller has built in a time bomb to totally kill itself at some point in the not too distant future?  Stay away from Fire tablets and spend the extra money to get a better tablet.Here's the follow up...as expected performance has continued to degrade and now can't search the internet nor can I stream movies and TV without having to constantly re-boot.  What a piece of garbage that Amazon does not support and trying to get a replacement is even a bigger joke!  People do not buy this junk at any price!Hers my update…smashed this giant POS with a hammer today. People, don’t buy this garbage. Pluck you Amazon and Jeff Bezos!Here's another update, just ordered my new Ipad because this piece of shift is so bad I'm happy to spend the extra money on something better.  People, don't buy this cheap garbage!",
0,,"Low price, decent value I’m surprisingly happy with this tablet. A few weeks ago, I bought my son the Fire HD 8. After installing google play store the value is unbeatable. I knew I had to have one, so I decided to get the upgraded Plus. I can’t honestly say I notice the 1gb RAM difference, but the wireless charging with a sort of “Echo Mode” is quite nice.The battery lasts a long time and the screen is crisp and bright. The speakers are subpar. Touch screen is smooth and responsive. Overall you get quite a lot for very little money with this tablet. I used a tutorial put together by androidpolice for installing The Play Store which took less than 10 minutes.",,,
1,"Fire 8 Plus needs more work I bought three of these and returned them all. There were floating dead spots on the screen. Sometimes you could type fine, but sometimes you would have to keep rotating the screen in order to use the space bar. On two of them Prime Video stopped working. There was no fix, even after working extensively with customer service. The device had to be factory reset to get Prime Video to work again. I would not recommend. I sent them all back and got the regular Fire 8 instead. The Plus needs more work.",,,,
2,,"Loving the bigger tablet First of all, I wasn't expecting this until Friday.  It was in the mail today so very fast delivery!I love using the Alexa because it's hands free.  Gotta work on the websites it brings up but I'm sure I'll get it worked out.I like it because it's bigger than my 7.  It even lets me call my contacts on it.  So good because I can't usually find my phone.I would eventually like to get a 10 so I can use it as a computer.  Thanks Amazon!",,,
3,,Classy I like the size and ease of use,,,

Although I am still getting used to everything it has to offer, there are a few apps that I would have liked to see on here but are not. I do a lot of reading so this has been wonderful for me to take along to my bedroom at night where I don't need to turn on the light to read.  Very nice tablet and would recommend this to anyone that is familiar with tablets.",,,
5,"CPU too slow when I'm a hurry I thought having 3gb would be enough, but when I'm using it on my break at work and I'm trying to load a show on hulu and netflix it takes forever, the CPU is just too weak it's my second amazon tablet and they both have great screens and great prices, but it's just too slow when you're in a hurry, it's the same problem, I'm just gonna have to buy a Samsung or an IPad from those crooked ass people at Apple.",,,,
6,,GOOD PRODUCT I AM VERY SATISFIED,,,
7,,"Not without a few drawbacks, but still great. I use this for all portable media and light computing and its invaluable!  Three annoying pet peeves though: 1) It will not cast by default unless a monitor is SmartCast compliant, 2) It will not accept a power pass-through hub under any circumstances, 3) The Memory Expansion feature is quite finicky with apps as not all can be installed if external memory is formatted for ""Removable"". If one can overlook these, get a 256g SD card and a cover/stand and you're good to go.",,,
8,,"Fire 8+ We’ve had a few of the 7” Fire Tablets (gens 1 and 2) and never had any issue.  I expected the same with the 8HD+ and was not disappointed.  We opted for the package deal with the charging cradle giving this gem a home while not in use.  It functions mostly as a wind down device for me.  I read the news, watch videos, and play games mostly; however, I’ve recently used for the NHL app and Hulu.  It doesn’t stutter nor jump.  Very happy.",,,
9,,"Love it, Cover needs camera hole on front cover so when folded back it is not blocked. Have to hold out of way, kind of awkward",,,
0,,,,"Not functional Extremely slow, even to close an app.The touch screen is imprecise. Annoyingly so. Example:  you can always use the browser's back button but many sites have a back arrow within the site. It'll being you back one page *on that site*  Just not on the Fire.If you are at the very top of the page it works as planned, to bring you back one page *on that site*  However, if you've scrolled down even a tiny bit, clicking the site's back arrow brings you back one page outside the site. You then need to go back to the site you were on and waste time finding where you left off. Very annoying. Wasting much time.Opening a photo, and trying to close it by clicking the x that's on then photo, will also sometimes bring you back a page - despite the fact that the x to close is nowhere near the back arrow.Imprecise screen also affects typing. I've never had to correct more than on this.I don't believe I've got a rare lemon. I ordered two, one for myself and one for a gift. I had to take back the gift because these issues were too frustrating for the recipient.It doesn't seem to understand copy / paste. I mean, the commands are there. It seems I've copied, it just won't paste.Obviously you can't compare the Fire to an iPad. But I'm not new to tablets. The Fire is vastly inferior to every one I've used.Pros: screen quality is very good. Battery life seems good - although it's so frustrating to use, I don't use it much.  Maybe that's why the battery lasts.So basically I can play a few games on these.",
1,"It's fast but dissapoints in other areas. Touch screen sensitivity can't be adjusted...too much in my opinion.  Screen size seems small compared to my old 8.9"" Kindle of 8 years.  Very limited apps from Amazon...Google Play was added for more versatility.  Some unwanted (baked in apps) that are never used-- uninstallable.  Prefer keyboard showing individual keys vs floating letters...available apps are disappointing in usefulness.  Wireless charging won't work unless Kindle is taken out of add on case.  Supplied charger cord way too short.  Doesn't transfer all games from old Kindle.",,,,
2,,"Finally a tablet with wireless charging I primarily use a tablet for reading and browsing.  There is nothing more frustrating after reading in bed to fumble around in the dark to find a charging cable.  The solution?  Wireless charging.  The HD 8 Plus is awesome.  Its funny how I see all these reviews nitpicking about the HD8 Plus feeling cheap, plastic, too big of bezel, not good enough touch screen, won't support gaming etc etc etc.  I especially laugh at the ones that don't like the USB-C port.  Seriously?  Its wireless charging dummies.  The critics have to get a real life.  This is the perfect tablet for most people.  The price is right too.",,,
3,,"Price is right!  Clarity, memory and function is there! NICE little tablet.  I don't need to see three screens at once, design charts and templates.  I just need a reader, ability to get on the internet, take a few pics, stream..., you get the idea.  While I am definitely an Apple user, an Ipad wasn't necessary for my purposes.  Perfect for me.  Do your research between a fire table and an ipad, evaluate your own purposes to make a decision, and you'll see what I mean.  While not designed to last a long, long time, for the price, well...it fits my needs exactly and Amazon sure got this one right.",,,
4,,Great Kindle table Love that perfect yo hold a night time and read when i can't sleep. A plus that come with Alexa,,,
5,,This is a good piece of tech that I enjoy using. I use this kindle fire for audiobooks. It’s very efficient,,,
6,Free Case ? It stated free case with order via Caseable. What they don't tell you that you get a $7.00 credit towards a case and there are varying prices at Caseable. The prices aren't bad but the one I chose I ended up paying $2.00 more. Wish they would have stated upfront the credit towards a case and not till you check out. Otherwise I love the new Kindle which is much faster than my years old Kindle.,,,,
7,,"Works as Advertised........works Great! I had another Fire 8 that I've had for over 3 years.  Use every day and it's just about worn out.  So I decided to get another one when the new ones came out.  I transferred everything seamlessly.  Got my books and videos.  I love the wireless charging and how fast it charges.  The battery last so much longer than my old one.  I am so happy about the price so I got it fully loaded in memory.  Needless to say, I'm happy about all Fire offers.  My only wish is that is was more ""Android"" than ""Fire"" and made it easy to use Google since my laptop is set up fully google.",,,

So much flexibility: surfing the WEB, streaming TV, Prime Movies, Net Flix, YouTube, reading our Kindle Books, checking my email, etc etc etc.  Both my wife and I are so happy with these Fire HD 8 Plus'.  We also got the Sony HD510 wireless headsets so we can both watch different things or read at bedtime.  The interface is simple and easy to use.  And these so much less expensive than the tablets.  Only 79 dollars on sale!!!  What a deal; hard to believe you get so much for this money.",,,

I won't use this for work (I have another tablet for that), but it's great for trips, commuting, watching shows/movies, and web browsing.  The only thing that I wish were better were the graphics.  I know it's a cheap tablet, but if you open up Instagram, for example, you can see how pixelated the images are.  It's definitely not what you think of when you see ""HD"".",,,,

AMZ should be focusing on the HD 10 and maybe even add 4gb of ram & a faster processor. THEN, we would really have something. But AMZ probably won’t let it’s Engineers do anything even close to that. Instead we just get crumbs from the table.",,,,
3,,So much faster than the original 8 My previous Fire 8 had finally gotten a crack in it so I needed a new one. I'm very happy I purchased the HD 8 Plus tablet. It is so much faster and smoother. Now I just need to purchase a case because the 8 Plus is slightly larger.,,,
4,,,"Bad engineering The power button is located on the same side and just a little bit lower than the volume up and down buttons. I mean REAL close. I can't tell you how many times I went to change the volume and accidentally turned OFF the tablet. Very frustrating! You think the designers would have noticed this and put the power button on the other side. Like on my older smaller Fire tablet. PLUS, no one makes a good cover. The one I bought is awkward to say the least. I hate it!",,
5,,,,"Turns Itself On I had a problem with finding this turned on and running down the battery.  i found out every time it's plugged in to charge, it will turn itself on.  I tried some things and then contacted support.  After a couple of hours, getting disconnected and support staff not knowing what the problem is, they finally said there is no option to change that flaw.  Why would they just leave that flaw and not even attempt to fix it?So, I turned off WiFi, turned off the device and put it on the shelf.  I'll see if I can find someone who wants it and I will give it to them.  I will never buy another fire tablet.",
6,"Adding Google Play So far really enjoying the tablet. Needing apps from Google Play took some time but eventual installed. I might be doing something wrong, but Home Screen has no visible control buttons at the bottom and I can not get to the App Screens to select apps. Changed from Alexa to Amazon(easier for me to pronounce), stating Amazon Home page..Amazon go Home, Amazon App Screen, and only stays at the ??home screen?? not sure but would really like to be able to touch a button or use a simple command to get to the App Screen.",,,,
7,,,"Not worth upgrading a 2016 Fire HD 8. I thought that this would Be an upgrade over my current Fire HD 8. It is not. This Fire HD 8 Plus, is actually SLOWER while using the internet than my 2016 model. Side by side test. The plus, which contains 3 GB RAM (vs 2 GB) is not even noticeable except in the $20 price difference. The 2020 version is short and wider. The on/off button has been moved slightly. The battery is better, but my battery is 4 years old, so that is expected. The screen can be dimmed easier and with many more levels.If you do not have a tablet, and want one, this is a great option. If you are looking to upgrade, save your money.YouTube still isn’t an available app. VUDU isn’t available, either. So if you have online content from other services, you are out of luck. For the most valuable company in America, they could certainly produce a better tablet. Especially, when you consider it is more mess a portal to buy more from Amazon.",,

1,,,Really slow and loses battery fast I have had kindles for years and got this to be able to have a lighter weight kindle to read my books and watch my shows. However I am supper disappointed. The battery barely lasts 24 hours on a new kindle with only reading books. Also it’s supper slow and the touch screen is constantly is unresponsive. Please think twice before getting one of these.,,
2,Great little Tablet So far we do like our new tablet. It has a lot of features we have enjoyed on our other tablets. Only thing we do miss is the older ones use to shutdown and restart automatically when you shut the case door. Which made it very convenient without searching  for the on/off power button next to the volume buttons. We are very please though so far with it's quality.,,,,
3,,,"Good price for a good tablet The tablet is good, the price is well below average for an 8"" tablet. However, I do not like the idea that Amazon gets to choose which apps I can download. Amazon also locked out all Google apps. If I pay for a product, it becomes my property, so Amazon should not dictate to keep me away from their competition's products and services. The Amazon App store doesn't compare to Google's store. So I will return this good tablet and will be getting an unlocked tablet. Perhaps a Samsung or Asus.",,

If you are someone that prefers a device that is set up to use only the manufacturers software or options, you will love this device. If you are someone like myself and prefer to be able customize the device to what you want you will hate it. This is the least customizable android based tablet I have ever purchased. I cannot install my preferred web browser (Mozilla Firefox) or email client (Thunderbird). I cannot even get it to connect to the android market to download apps. I have to go thru Amazon to download apps, and they don't have all my preferred apps there. I have yet to figure out how to change the apps that are on my home screen. There I are several apps there that I would never use and I cannot remove them to make room for ones that I would use. I cannot change the wallpaper to my personal photos without uploading my pictures to the cloud first. I cannot permanently disable Alexa either. I have to use the ""force stop"" every time I power up the device. The hardware of this device is good, but the software is locked into everything and anything that is Amazon. I also purchased the micro SD card that is marketed as specifically for this device and the device keeps saying the SD card is not install when it is installed. I would have been better off to purchase a different tablet and just downloaded the kindle app.",

My only criticism is that if the power cord is disconnected after the tablet is turned off or is disconnected after charging, the Fire 8 turns itself back on which can be aggravating.  However, this aggravation does not deter me from highly recommending his product.",,,

Set up was easy, however it irks me that I cannot delete programs that I will never use, so I’m stuck with them eating up my storage space indefinitely. Unfortunately, this is the trend on tablets, phones and even laptops now. The majority of use for me will be using the kindle feature, Prime movies and Netflix.",,,,

The previous Fire 8 I used was the 2018 model, and it was slow and sometimes crashed if I tried to do more than one function. One frequent use of mine is to read from the Kindle app and use the web browser to research what I am reading. I can switch back and forth with no issues! I would definitely recommend this tablet. I feel the extra RAM and CPU power is worth the extra cost. Plus, the USB C port is welcome too.",,,
5,,Good for the money. This is a pretty good little tablet for the money. Especially when it’s on sale. I wish Amazon would make an 8” fire with a 1080p screen. That would be the perfect fire HD. The battery life is really good and the speakers sound great. Especially given there are only two. It charges decently fast (up to 15w). The wireless charging is interesting but not super useable. When you “dock” it on a wireless charger it turns the tablet into a Echo Show which is cool. USB-C is a very welcome change. Over all I like it for how I use it. Definitely doesn’t replace an iPad for power users.,,,
6,,Love the storage options! My boyfriend bought me this for my birthday and I love it. This is my second Fire tablet and I am a lifer. The graphics are fantastic. The speed is great. The storage options with this tablet are phenomenal! It has 64 gigs onboard and accepts up to 1 terabyte SD cards AND you have the option to format the SD card in such a way that it becomes permanent onboard storage! The charger is the Usb- c type which means you don't have to figure out which side is front or back. The only drawback for me about it is that now I have to buy extra chargers because it is not interchangeable with my other devices.,,,

It came to the point where I had to delete almost everything.The only drawback to the Fire is you have to use the Amazon Store apps.  I haven't found a good way to access Google Play Store.  Lost a few apps that only appear on that site. I was able to get games that store info to Facebook however.",,,

With 200+ books it took a couple weeks to get all moved to the Fire.  That to me is unacceptable.  The biggest problem was in getting books grouped by author.  Once the books were moved, it is a much better unit for reading books then the paper white.

Está pensado y diseñado básicamente para entretenimiento, consumo multimedia, lectura de libros, Netflix y sus similares. Para ese propósito, me parece que el dispositivo cumple a la perfección.Es cómodo, de construcción sólida y agradable, y en general creo que es la mejor opción para ocio.

Touch screen and memory or processing issues I'm thinking.And my biggest annoyance and may trigger a return...the button placement...sigh. constantly slipping and powering off while watching a show or having volume go up to max. This causes show to completely exit in Prime...which is moronic. I have to scroll down, click, click, click...just to get back to show because of a slippery back and bad placement of buttons for viewing.All in all, not nearly as impressed as I was with my last few fires...and never will be as impressed as I was with my 3rd gen hdx...why can't Amazon understand they screwed up taking such a huge leap away from that?!",,

5,,"Great tablet at a great price! I bought two of these for my two sons to keep them entertained during frequent long-distance road trips (their mother and I have shared custody of them but live 5 hours apart).  My sons have used them extensively on the highway, but have also used them at home quite a bit.  They use the tablets for playing games on the highway and for shopping online at home.  We have also considered watching movies on the tablets but haven't done so yet.  Very user-friendly, good screens, long-lasting battery charge, reasonable price, EXCELLENT VALUE !!  My sons and I are thoroughly pleased.",,,
6,,"Pretty Good. It's a pretty good tablet. Picture quality is nice, the sound quality is great for a little tablet. It's actually surround sound quality. Lots of great features. Battery life is okay, but it goes fast, especially if you're on the Kindle side. (about a few hours) But watching videos, or games, it usually last me a day and a half from full charge. Touch screen is okay, super fast scrolling. So far I have no issues and I'm loving my little tablet.",,,
7,,,,,"Disappointed I bought this because my 8th gen Fire HD tablet wouldn't automatically update, starting with the November 2020 update, causing me to have to manually update before I could download new books.Upon arrival, I immediately downloaded the 400ish books in my library onto my device.  Then, I tried to update the Kindle.  The update wouldn't download, so I had to download it to my laptop and manually update the device.  Now, I'm unable to download new books that I've purchased.  I've had 15 booked in my download queue for a week, and one book has actually downloaded.  So, it seems that the issue with my old device was related to Amazon software updates, and I didn't need this one.Aside from updates, the battery life on my 10th gen Kindle is about half of that of my 8th gen Kindle.  While the screen is still 8"", this kindle (with case) is shorter, wider, and slightly heavier than the 8th gen, so it's a bit more awkward to hold in one hand and use as an e-book reader...plus it no longer fits in the back pocket of a pair of jeans.I don't recommend this to anyone who is purchasing a Kindle as a reading device.  It might be alright, if Amazon would not release so many updates."
8,,,Good but less than I expected I traded my previous Kindle for this one because of the updated USB-C charging plug and the wireless charging. I thought that it would be better in every way but it wasn't. The screen is less bright than expected and the repositioned buttons are more difficult to use.  Also while the screen interface was slimmed down from my previous version it is still a step or two behind my phone and what I had hoped. I have several Kindles. I have the Kindle with keyboard that I use for my commuting. I have the 7 inch and 8 inch kindles and I have a 10 inch kindle.  Previously I used my 8 inch often to watch videos because of its smaller size and used the 10-inch for movies. But my new Kindle has a less bright screen and makes me use my 10-inch more often.,,
9,,"Best Kindle I've ever had. I love this Kindle.  It doesn't use battery life when I have it unplugged & not using like my last one did.  ( I think it was HD 7)  It's easy to use for a person like me without very much computer/kindle skills.  I can read books, watch Netflix, watch prime videos, listen to music, connect to Instagram, play games and connect with Facebook.  I'm sure there is more to this Kindle & in time I will learn it.  Thank you Amazon for recommending this Kindle for me. This is exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend this Kindle.  Your customer service is beyond great.",,,
0,,"This is an awesome tablet at a great price We bought the original Kindle fire when it first came out. It was nice, but it has been improved massively since.  I bought one of these for my wife (who is not very computer savvy) and my adult daughter. They both LOVE them. You can do so much with this unit - and the wireless charge capability makes it so much easier to charge.  (the only reason our original fire died was that the charge plug port wore out - so we really prefer wireless charging. This is an excellent unit at a price well below most android and especially apple tablets.",,,

2,"Slow, not as fast I expected. Since this is supposedly the newest release, I was expecting it to be faster and better.  I have the Fire HD 10 2019, and is way better than Fire HD 8plus.  The 3 GB RAM doesn’t do any better.  There is a noticeable delay response when I scroll along a page.  I recommend the Fire HD 10, it comes with octa-core processor.",,,,
3,,,,"I honestly wish I could give this zero stars. The play of Audible books is bad.  Often stopping for no reason while in progress. I can listen to a chapter or two then the playback halts.  I have to exit the screen and go back to the badly modified new Home screen, back to Audiobooks and back to the book I was reading, at which point the most recent chapter or two have to play again.  Lately it has gotten even worse after 6 service calls and giving them access to my logs, not when it goes bad it resets to the start of the book.  I am sick to death of the bad product and the bad service.  If you have a library of higher quality MP3 recordings on your computer, you can no longer transfer them to your tablet with the album artwork displayed, which has been a problem free function of the prior models. The album artwork is displayed for online music, but not for your offline library even if you transferred the artwork with it.  Makes it much more difficult to locate the album you want if you have a large library.  Always worked in prior editions, so for some reason Amazon has removed that function. At least six separate chat sessions for help did not solve the problem and the second one resulted in an argument from the service rep.  I now purportedly have a team working on the audible playing problem ONLY, for the last eight weeks with no resolution and very little actual contact.  This Fire Tablet is substantially less than the last edition that I had. these defects are inexcusable when the unit costs as much as it does.  The 'service reps' are no longer trying to help, so I have to assume that the defects are permanent.",
4,Overall the new tablet is around the same as my previous Fire 7 9th generation ... However one of the reasons I purchased this version as I HOPED that the sound output would be at least as loud as my last Fire purchase but the sound is not as loud.  It's just slightly quieter.  I use them both to listen to audible audio books.  However it's good enough that I won't send it back.  Now I need to find earplugs or headset the will fit into that smaller hole for the mono audio plugin.,,,,
5,,"A great Tablet. I purchased this tablet to surf the web, read emails ,watch movies and to message friends and family.

The size is perfect for me ,the screen is large enough for me to read my emails and watch movies. The cameras and.speakers are good.

And I need a case because I'm afraid of damage to the screen.  So for NOW I am using my older reader.Downloading speed -- OH BABY THIS DOWNLOADS SO MUCH FASTER THAN my older Kindle reader.

Storage space is a great improvement. I haven't had any WiFi issues that others have had in their review. Bottom line: if you like using Amazon services this is a great media tablet.

I'm sure the ""regular"" 8 would work fine, but the 8+ battery life, the ease and speed(!) of recharging, as well as the responsiveness for searches makes it worth a few extra $$.

A decent reading tablet but that's all it can be.After extensive research, it seems as if the new Fire 8 and fire 10 (10th and 9th gen) have broken notifications for almost all apps.Want to alerted when you have a discord notification, or when you have Instagram activity? Nope. Won't work.I have disabled all power management and made sure notifications were turned on but it's useless.Another bummer is you cannot set a different home screen and lockscreen wallpaper without a 3rd party tool. Really?? Laughable.The battery life however is very good! Wireless charging works as intended. No wireless dropouts. Screen resolution is sharp enough for reading.Tldr, a great reading tablet. But if you are expecting more, save up a bit more cash and get a Tab A or an iPad (non pro).",,

I upgraded to the no ads and it was well worth it according to people I've talked to that have the ones with ads.

This one just doesn't seem to live up to the Amazon Firename.First it's screen seems a little dull compared to the 2017 version I had (after 4 years it started going down hill - not charging and so on, knew it was time for a new one). Trying to brighten the screen didn't work but it was okay. I'm big on reading so not a big deal - or so I thought.Now it's lagging behind - it's still in it's warranty stage so I can send it in for repair but the way the repair has been handled isn't making me a happy person. The guy on the phone trouble shooting told me to - get this - reboot my router! Now I work from home and rarely have issues with my router. My TV runs off of it - wirelessly - my work set up runs off it wirelessly - so really??? My router! I told him it wasn't downloading books - when my TV, phone and laptop were doing fine.So I am now sending it back with Amazon saying they will have their techs look at it! Either send me a new one or repair mine!I use Amazon a lot - like the rest of the US - have never had problems getting something fixed or replaced but this whole experience has left me with a bad taste in my mouth.I know how warranties work but I should have just returned it when the while thing with the screen happened.I will see how this all plays out in the end!",
9,About 3 times  more responsive and a  lot faster than Kindle Fire7 I don't have to stomp on the buttons to get a response on the Kindle 8 Plus. It downloads very smoothly and quickly. The battery life last 3 times longer than that of the Kindle Fire 7.  The Kindle 8 Plus is well worth the extra  cost. This is my 3rd Kindle. I'll never go back to the 7.,,,,
0,Excellent tablet.  Very sturdy. I live everything about this tablet except I cannot figure out how to keep unsolicited pop ups trying to get me to buy games.  I am a reader not a gamer and this is very annoying.  If anyone can tell me how to correct this irritating issue i would be 100% happy.,,,,
1,Apps Their are a lot of games and different apps that I wish amazon had. It seemed like every game that I wanted on it wasnt available. I got lucky with one game and its been around for sometime. I wonder if maybe they dont have anything new. All the games that are suggested or are available are at least 5 years or older I love the tablet and I use it everyday I just was upset about that,,,,
2,,Great tablet For the price it's a great tablet. Yes it doesn't have GPS chip but you can tether the GPS  from phone and use it as a GPS device. I bought it so I can use my GPS app for trucking. I works great when tethered.  The battery life is great I've been using it as I said as a GPS for a full day and the battery has never gone bellow 30 %. the speakers are not very loud but for the price point they are fine. It's possible to get play store and have the apps that you need it takes less than 10 mins to do it.,,,

While I don't get video ads, I still get annoying ads for Amazon coins and other stupid video games that I don't want.  I paid enough for this tablet, why should I have to pay to not get ads.

When you tap on ""see all your books""  nothing happens.  Cannot get them to come up.  Went to customer service.  Had chat with one fella and them the chat disappeared.  Tried the call me.  Was told to hang on while they checked the transcript of the chat so they would know what was tried.  After 8 + minutes I gave up waiting for them to come back.  Tried call me again.  Nice lady.  Tried a few things to see if we could reboot and then she suggested I reset the router.  Did that and lost my phone line when I did.  Gave up at that point.  Will try another day when I'm not irritated.  I had such great hopes.  Hope to update this soon with good news.UPDATE.  After spending more than an hour with a delightful young man, it was determined that the programing could not be fixed.  He then arranged for another Kindle 8 to be delivered to me the next day.  I do appreciate that they continued to solve my problem and when they could not, replaced it.  Very happy now."

I wish Amazon would bring back mirroring for my television. They had it in older versions and it worked great. I also wish they would allow out of Amazon Universe Apps. Google Play would really expand the Fire’s versatility.All the negatives aside, Kindle Fire is till an outstanding tablet for a fraction of the cost of its competitors.

5,,,Could be better I use to be able to play the games i like on my kindle fire and this one i can't and that makes me wonder if I wasted my money.  Won't  buy another one or  recommend it to anyone like i use to.,,
6,,Great item I really like the rapid response requests.  Games are clear & fast.  Good screen quality.  My only con is when I try the reading app because I have trouble moving from page or chapter.  The paper white is an easier reading device.,,,
7,"Just don’t like ads Got this tablet for use around the house basically for recipes and reading and to watch Netflix when I’m not at home. LOVE the tablet! Works great, screen quality is really nice! The only thing I regret about my purchase is I got the tablet with ads! Wish I would just sprung for the without ads edition! Other than that I’m very happy with my purchase!",,,,
8,,,"Great tablet, poor smart assistant software. Works great as a tablet and digital reader, about as much as you'd expect for the price. However the show-mode is pretty much not functional for every day use now. Whenever I put it in the charging stand and it goes into show mode, I have to say ""Alexa!"" quite a few times before it actually will register my command. Seems to have started doing this after an update. Every other feature works fine except for talking to Alexa or the show mode.Also have my alarm set to this device through the show mode, and every other day it seems the alarm will not trigger, despite me having it set for every weekday.I'd say get it as a tablet, wireless charging dock is cool, but not worth the hassle of the current show mode performance.",,

0,"Recording issues Brought new Kindle because previous one was at least 10 years old.  Was having issue trying to record video message to send for a friends retirement and the quality and sound was horrible.  Actually having same issue with this Kindle, but overall serves its general purpose. Not able to contact anyone to find out what I'm doing wrong if anything.",,,,
1,,the battery life is awesome i was very surprised by the battery life. the color on the screen is very nice too. I wish i'd bought one of these years ago.,,,
2,,,Volume. It’s not loud enough I dislike the volume not being loud enough,,
3,,LOVE this fire tBlet This was a major upgrade fire me! It is fast. Has long battery life. Screen is big and so many more options .,,,
4,,Convenient Only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with Google play.,,,
5,,Great value and even better kindle fire! I read alot and my eyes need bigger screen. With the 8+ kindle the bigger letters make the screen look more natural. Works faster too. Very pleased with this kindle.,,,
6,"Good, not great It's a good tablet, unfortunately it's not great. All the Amazon apps work well and performance is on par with any other Android tablet.The browser performance is very poor. Simple pages are slow to load, more complex take even longer.I just found an app in the Appstore that speeds up internet performance a whole bunch. It's called WiFi & Internet fix up. If you have this tablet or are considering it, you should get the app!",,,,
7,,,Battery drains quickly I I truely a Kindle Fire fan. This Kindle is disappointing because the battery drains quickly and it is frustrating. I have issues with battery drain even when the internet feature is disabled. In previous Kindles I only had severe battery drain if using the internet. Now it's a constant problem. I have to keep it plugged in when using it or the Kindle dies after a few hours.The recharging stand is also useless because if you have a cover on the Kindle it's as lost impossible to charge. For me it was wasted money. Also the thing charges really slowly even when the cover is removed.Newer wasn't better with this Kindle.,,
8,,Best Fire Yet. Long Battery life and wireless charging are a big plus. Touch screen sometimes too sensitive and you can lose what you are working on. Otherwise I highly recommend.,,,
9,,Kindle Fire Love my new Kindle.  It is just what I was wanting.,,,
0,"I like it I never thought I would buy something to read an e-book with but I am now a believer. The screen is touchy and it loses its place easily when I stop reading for awhile, and its hard to figure out the menus with no written instructions that I can find, but all electronics are now like that. I paid enough so you'd think they would spend a buck and give us a written manual.",,,,
1,,Downloads go to internal storage I had a Fire 7 the Hd 8 is way better. You can use internet on the 8 the 7 is way to slow for internet use. The speakers sound real good to me . Again way better than the 7. Also the screen being bigger makes it easier to read stuff. All apps load fast. I watch Discovery + picture is very good. If you're going download lots of movies etc get the 64.,,,
2,Nice Tablet for the Value Compliments to Amazon Customer Service Team for assistance to understand practical uses. This is a nice tablet with many various options to use for everyday tasks and internet skills. I like the size and long lasting charging. I ordered this Amazon Fire by request from my sister who uses hers daily reading and emails. Great price and a good value.,,,,
3,"Good value for the price I like the 2 new features.  1. You can charge wirelessly 2. You can charge with a C usb plug.I don't like that when you are using an app it sometimes will close on its own.I had a Kindle 10"" screen before so I am getting use to the 8"" screen.I use the Kindle mainly to check email and read booksI also use it to play music and watch videos.  I have not tried to play games yet.",,,,
4,,"Great Kindle 8 plus with a couple of minor inconveniences I'm VERY satisfied with this new Fire 8 plus.  It's so fast and the battery lasts a lot longer than the previous Kindle Fire.  I was a bit disappointed that the USB port is different, so now I can't charge it in my car until I get a new charger, but that's just a minor inconvenience.  Another small problem I found was that the cover I had used on my previous Kindle (6th generation) is not quite the same dimensions as this new one, so had to purchase another protection cover for it.  Still, this is a greatly improved Kindle and a great price.  Not sorry I purchased it.",,,
5,,"Worth More Than the Price What advantage does an IPad have over this, about $500. We have 6 Kindle Fires 8 & 10. I only had 1 that failed, the micro connection, but at $50 not a problem. It does everything you need. I added a 128G SIM card and loaded all my music collection.",,,
6,"Spectacular in most every way Have trouble downloading some items. Some are slow. Mostly links. Not streaming. Some don't open I think the problem may be my internet . Still new to me so I am a little clumsy at first. It was a birthday gift that I had been looking at. I received the tablet, case, wireless charger. It is all so handy. Great device.",,,,
7,,"Great tablet for the price. Great tablet for the price I needed this to play some Catan, read Kindle and use it for configuring the echo devices I have.Glad didn't pay for an iPad mini for my own use cases.",,,
8,,"Nice little table I brought this to replace the 10 year old 7 inch 16g  Kindle Fire that finally died. I only use it for reading or my grandsons games and for him to watch Netflix in the car. I don’t use it to surf the web, or for email or social media. Since I only plan to use this Kindle Fire you specific tasks, I expect it will hold up well. So far I love it the picture is very clear, the sound is great and right now I am very please with this purchase.",,,
9,,"Love it!!! This one is smaller than the one I had previously, but I actually like it better!  It has more features, is faster, and has much better battery life.",,,
0,"Best possible value ever Best Value possible! I needed a small tablet and this hit the mark, with all my Amazon Kindle and purchases on board. Not every Google Play app is in the Amazon App Store but the ones you need are there. Only improvements needed would be for the audio. Bring a headset or Bluetooth speaker for noisier environments.",,,,
1,"Fire HD8 Plus - Can enable for Google Apps if you miss them If you're looking to use some Google apps, you will need to hunt the internet to find out how enable Fire HD8 Plus with Google apps.  It took me several tries, but there's one on YouTube that was pretty easy to follow.  You may have to disable Alexa in favor of talking to Google.  It didn't matter to me since I don't use Alexa but do talk to Google.",,,,

3,,It’s easy to work It’s easy to work,,,
4,"Great deal I bought it for my sister and I have to say that I'm in love with this tablet, I side loaded Google play for her and downloaded apps like YouTube, word, excel, Facebook (from apps store) and games like call of duty and order & chaos and all of them work very smooth, the only thing that I dislike is the sound performance, maybe this one has more sound quality that my fire 7 but I feel that the fire 7 is kinda louder.",,,,
5,,,The size is smaller than I would have liked email and games while traveling.,,
6,,"Another fine Fire tablet! There is much to like here and this version of the Fire tablet adds some new tech. The wireless charging feature is really great as it eliminates the need to plug in to recharge. This unit seems to be more difficult to keep the screen clean. Fingerprints and smudges resist being wiped off. Looks like a screen protector will be needed. With so much of the newer tech finding it's way into this model it looks like a sharper video image would have been a wise addition. I like the fact that you can add up to a 1 terabyte memory card to this tablet. Overall, a very fine tablet!",,,
7,"Lackluster Battery life is not impressive. Not sure what a lower end device is like, but given the lackluster of this one, I would say don't do it unless it's for a child. Could be thinner too. Just not really impressed for the price at all. Should come with the wireless charger free at least. Got the HD 8plus with 64GB ad supported one that the review is for.",,,,
8,I love the new charging feature. I love the new charging feature. With the other devices I was having to purchase a new charging cord every couple of months because the little tabs on the plug would press down and no longer stay plugged into the device.  I have this new charging device on my cell phone and in the months that I have owned it there has been no problems so I expect the same from my new kindle's charging feature.,,,,
9,,"Replaced old 7"" Replaced my old 7"" I had, had about 5 years. Works good. I use mostly for e-books, a few games and Amazon orders. The little bit larger screen on this 8"" does make everything larger so I like that.",,,
0,,Easy to use and like having a PC in your hand I love using the tablet while sitting in my recliner watching TV.,,,
1,,,it's not user friendly Most for reading and take pictures. unlike my 7 HD everything was transferred over from preview Kindle but none off my over 300 books from 7 HD transfer over to this 8 HD kindle and customer service person from Kindle can't help me to transfer those over.,,
2,"This works for me I enjoy the new tablet. Just really loved the HDX version. But this works for what I need. And there are some new features that this has that my previous didn't. Glad that the screen set up is similar, it didn't take long to adjust. Battery works really well but the cases could work a little better to charge through. All in all its a keeper!",,,,
3,,,Not what I expected! I cannot download the apps I really want. I’ve been had!!! Cannot download the apps I really wanted!,,
4,"Not what I expected At first I was kind of skeptical, I have the fire 7 device and didn't think the fire HD 8 plus would be that much different. I was completely wrong. The fire HD 8 plus is so much better in every way. I'm so glad I have the plus in my life. Thank you Amazon.",,,,
5,"Great device with a lot of options. Fast set up and easy to use. Everything is perfect. This device does about all you could ask for in an easy to operate format. The only complaint I would post is that this was purchased as a package (a great package) with the feature of NO ADS. Yet, all of the free games have ads. If you want to be ad free, you have to pay a fee. What's up with that? I paid for a non ad package.",,,,
6,,Great Great 👍🏿 👌🏾,,,
7,,"Like it better than 7"" I love it!  I appreciate the larger screen than the other 7"" Kindles I have had.  The menus are not the same, and I prefer the old menus, but everything else is fine.  The only improvement I would make is, I carry my Kindle with we and can't use it when I am away from home and there is no Wifi.  Which it had Wifi attached through Amazon.",,,
8,,"For the price, it's a solid little tablet I have both the Fire 8 and Fire 8 plus and would recommend the plus. That extra ram makes a difference and Netflix and Hulu load a lot faster.",,,
9,,I really like my 8 plus. Not too big not too small. Just right. I really liked the picture quantity. Battery lasts longer when I'm on facebook Then when I use my phone. So that is a plus. The touch screen is very easy to use. All around great little tablet!!!,,,
0,,"A Great Value! Unlike other tablets I own, this table's home screen is easy to organize.  Kindle's reader app is the best for adjusting your book for color, type, etc.  The Fire HD 8 plus screen compares favorably to an I pad's, but the Fire's cost is way less.  I love the Alexa and the Ring Apps on the Fire as well.  Although the Fire is a bit heavy, I am very happy with my purchase.  The only complaint I have was the amount of time it took to get to me, since there is a distribution center a few miles away.",,,
1,"Surprisingly functional for what I wanted I wanted a device that would replace my Kindle paperwhite. I did not want to spend three or $400 to get an iPad mini, although the iPad mini is a better device. I did not want to spend that much money, and this device, at around $100, is perfect for what I needed to do. It is speedy enough, the dual band Wi-Fi seems to work well with my Wi-Fi. At this time, I certainly would buy it again.",,,,
2,,A good tool to own. It's an easy touch screen.,,,
3,,Holiday gift Got this for Christmas and took it traveling with me.  Loved how accessible it was for reading and videos.  The screen is clear and it was easy to download apps.  I really like my gift,,,
4,"Make sure it fits It is a great buy! I use the tablet primarily to read books. This is an upgrade from my old Fire seven... faster and brighter. The one downside for me is that it is wider... uncomfortably so. I could grip the seven in my hand, but this one is just too big to use it in the same way.",,,,
5,,"Daughter lives it Upgraded my 8 y/o from the kids pad she got last year and hated it, to this one. Was wanting an android based pad for her. This is not that. BUT it is way better than the kids version.",,,
6,,Good price Great tablet for price,,,
7,,"Responds fast Used for game playing ,pic good sound good…",,,
8,,pretty cool thing. I use it for reading. I like the color that shows up in the pictures in the book and the screen is just the right size. There are a lot of apps that come with it I haven't used yet.,,,
9,"I lost one I bought in 2017...I miss it An extra 16GB of storage and 50% more memory...no noticeable difference in performance.  The old one charged on the standard phone plug...not the new one...you gotta use the special one that comes with it (better not loose it) or you can pay $40 dollars for a wireless charging station. And you'd think in 3 years they could have put in a better camera.That said, to me, this is still the best tablet made for the money.",,,,
0,,"Lasted about a year My mom bought one, for herself, in October 2020. Today, she plugged it into to charge (it was half charged, when she did), and when she came back to use it, later, it wouldn't come on, but the screen glows, a little...but nothing happens when you try to turn it on...",,,
1,,"A Nice Upgrade I had a older HD8 a few years ago. And then traded it in for an HD10 a year or more ago which works fine. No complaints with either. Recently when the HD8 plus was on sale, I decided to get one. It's performance seems on par with my HD10. For what I do, I don't really notice the difference performance wise. The speakers though do seem  noticeably better than my HD10. But I do like the much smaller size and weight compared to the HD10. For my usage, the smaller size displays web pages just fine. The HD8 Plus is now my main tablet for routine usage.",,,
2,"Enjoyable user experience I love the kindle fire. My only complaint is the camera placement. I don't like the front facing camera on the side, I wish it was on the top like the older version. The battery life is great though even when watching videos. I love that it now takes the same charger as my cellphones. I wish the screen didn't get as much glare as it does, but the picture is great.",,,,
3,"Nice for the price 124.99 I bought this to use for Zoom, to watch videos and social media.  It works really well and is fast enough for what I need.  My 2 complaints are the sound volume doesn't go high enough and the screen isn't as clear as an older version that I have.  So much faster than the older version though.",,,,
4,,I love it everything you need at your fingertips. Personal use It has great screen qualityIt takes great pics.,,,
5,,,"Awkward operating system I’ve been using iPhones and iPads for years so the operations of those devices is now intuitive. The Fire Hd plus is simple but not intuitive to me. I can’t always find what I want. The buttons to tap on the screen aren’t labeled so it takes me several tries to find what I want or the task I want to do. I didn’t activate any kid stuff that I know of, but young child games and screens appear along with the sounds that go with them. I was hoping to have a simple, lightweight, inexpensive device to handle a few tasks, but you get what you pay for. I haven’t been able to figure out how to do what I want - simple spreadsheet and word processing. I’ll probably just use it as a Kindle reader.",,
6,"Easy to use We went from an IPad to the Fire. My 6 year old transitioned very easily. It’s only been 3 weeks & it has already froze up on him twice now.The tablet is easy to use, when it works.The price was good & He seems happy with it for what he does. I also like that an SD card gets you more space.",,,,
7,,"OUTSTANDING ! I upgraded from a 5th generation Fire 7 and this unit is so much better. The battery lasts forever (well - okay - maybe not that long but I can actually read almost two full novels with this and the 7 I barely got through one). it's fast and responsive, easy to use and the screen is clear and bright. I got the magnetic case with it and that is fantastic - wakes the unit when you open it and puts it to sleep when you close it. A great purchase for my reading habit (and goes well with Kindle Unlimited)",,,
8,,"Great Product Really love my new Fire. I mostly read using this device. It is significantly faster than my previous Fire, especially when I am using the Silk browser. It is light weight so it is easy to carry with you. I also purchased the show dock, which makes charging super easy and lets you use the Fire instead of a bedside clock/alarm. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a light use tablet for reading and/or watching movies. Too many other features to mention here but suffice it to say that you can do a lot with this Fire!",,,
9,"Somewhat Limited As a reader and platform for watching shows and movies, it's excellent.  Buy it if you primarily want a lightweight platform for entertainment with some tablet functionality.As a tablet, it's limited.  The app store is especially poor.  If you want an actual tablet with a wide range of functionality, get something else.",,,,
0,,"Decent little toy Doesn't feel like an expensive tablet, but it responds like one. Screen is really good for the price, but not stellar. My friend got the one with special offers and he regrets it. Not having commercials appear all over is more than worth it. Was able to install Google Store and it's adjutants, making the tablet really worth buying, since without it, it's just an Amazon services delivery device. Just so you know, to update the Google apps, I need to uninstall and reinstall them every time... So... Very annoying, but... For the price you pay, got to keep yer mouth shut... Still, would recommend it. It's a decent little toy.",,,
1,,,"Not bad for the money...... I probably expected too much, but their hype on how good this thing was made me buy it. It’s okay, but so much slower than my other tablet which is an iPad Pro 9.7.  The worst was the low volume you get out of any Bluetooth headphones. For that, I downloaded a volume booster, which actually made the sound worse.  The interface took me awhile to figure out how to get to all my normal stops on the web. I bought it to have a smaller tablet to carry around. For the first week, I thought no way, I’m gonna have to send this thing back!!  But kept working with it figuring things out & decided to keep it as a SMALLER tablet. FOR THE MONEY, IT’S PROBABLY WORTH IT.",,
2,,,Tablet quality I wouldn't recommend buying this product its slow And laggy not worth it. I bought it at half price like 53$ and Normal price is $103 So I wouldnt recommend buying this product.,,
3,"It's slightly large for holding in your hand & reading - love the battery life! I love love love the long battery life and am slowly getting used to the size.  It's slightly too big to hold in my hand, so I end up holding the edge of the screen a lot.  I think one of those knobs for holding a phone might work on it.  I do love the stand for charging too.",,,,
4,,works great a a lightweight inexpensive computer very impressed with quality versus price.  Will work fine as a inexpensive travel computer for files and internet access.  Only comment is the Amazon store has very limited and in many cases out of date applications.  I was able to work around by contacting the software vendor and gettng a URL to download the latest version and it works fine,,,
5,,Reliability Replaced earlier model,,,
6,,,"Backlight flickers This was purchased as a gift to me.  This is my 5th kindle and I am somewhat disappointed.  Though the battery life is good, the backlight night reading features is not as good as my kindle #4.  This one seems to fade on its own, even after I have set it to where it should be when it goes to night mode.  Then it will flicker back to bright again.  It also is not as easy on my eyes as my past kindles.  Overall, I like the kindle but would prefer to go back to my earlier edition due to the light issues.  Hence the overall rating of a ""3"" - which I never give on a review (I usually abstain from answering) - but felt this needs to be addressed.",,
7,"Improved battery life and up to date OS Had to replace my old Fire tablet for new OS to run Zoom and Overdrive.  Once registered, all of my my books and docs were readily available.  Battery life is excellent, although to screen time-out is a little short.The Favorites bar on the Silk home screen should be at the top instead of the bottom.",,,,
8,"It’s nice The media could not be loaded.
                



 It’s okay for kids. It lags a little but overall it’s good for simple stuff like reading or for kids. It would definitely need a case. Which I’ve purchased.It’s lightweight and would break easily if dropped.",,,,
9,Nice Addition to my Fire Devices Like it a lot. Have added a bluetooth keyboard. A suggested improvement: it makes an electronic chirping sound on a regular basis. I can't find where to turn it off. It is annoying and keeps me from having the tablet in my bedroom at night.  Please update the software (?) so I can turn it off.,,,,
0,,Fast! Kindle Fire 8 HD Plus.  Plugged in  and after putting in a password or 2 the whole kindle was updated and ready for me to use.  I like that it has the same format as my Generation 3 so I don't have to go looking for everything.Love love love the standup charger. I just leave the kindle on it at night and it's ready for me every time. No more messing with a plug. Worth the extra bucks.This Kindle is also faster than my old one.Love it.,,,
1,,Best for kids Easy to use and kids love this. It is strongly made too. Very useful for kindergarten kids.,,,
2,,"Almost everything is improved on the Fire 8+ The 8+ is much faster than my earlier versions of theFire 8 or my Fire 10. It has plenty of memory too. I love the C type charging port and the charge lasts longer too. The camera is much better, and the screen resolution is better on Zoom meetings.. The only problem I have is trying to get Google Play Store apps to install. There is a way, but I have not figured it out yet.",,,
3,,"Enjoyment I purchased this to use in my office with the plan to use my phone less. Works great. If I'm in the middle of watching movie and need to spend time in the kitchen, I prop it up on the counter. Great value for the price.",,,
4,,,,,"Absolutely Terrible WiFi & SD Card Support Just got my Fire HD 8 Plus a week ago. What a major disappointment. I did not expect this device to be high performer given the specs, but I had no idea how bad the wifi would be on this tablet. I have no issues with 10 or so other devices my family uses, but I'm about to throw this in the trash. Just a few of the top issues:- Cannot stream the simplest internet radio stations (e.g. iHeartRadio), constant buffering for 5-10 seconds. Dropping connections completely- Cannot stream live TV, constant buffering and pauses on ESPN+ and Hulu- Downloading content, to avoid streaming, takes forever and larger files will stop half way through due to ""communication issues""For the SD Card, I use a standard Samsung EVO 256GB card. Could not get the card to format on the device, had to resort to using a Linux tool to format the card. Then when I finally got the device to recognize the card it kept corrupting the card while writing files to it.At this point I am just happy I can use it to read books, but then again I could do that on my Kindle already and was hoping to have this to add additional media options.I mean I guess you get what you pay for :("

1,,Feels great in my hand! I tried to get one when it first came out bit they kept being sold out so I purchased a  10hd. I found it hard to hold and finally decided to go back and purchase the Fire 8. I sure am glad I did. What I really like is the size and weight of the tablet. Plus the quality of the picture is outstanding as well as the sound. I'm really enjoying my new tablet.,,,
2,,,"quirky I don't care for the size (my mistake for ordering). In my defense one needs a hands on to be sure.Learning the operation takes some doing. It's like seek and find.E-mail function is very unusual operation, at one point I had to shut the tablet down to get to where I could delete some email. For example: The trash can disappeared in my email so I couldn't delete, thus my reason for shutting down the tablet. The screen quality is very crisp and clear. Battery life seems to good.Reading an ebook was not fun because at one point the page was off the page. Often the tablet was jerky and slow.I would not recommend this tablet and If I had not discarded the packaging It would go back.",,

6,"Unrivaled for the cost This is an excellent device for what you're paying. I opted for the ""Plus"" model to have more RAM and would highly recommend that. Overall, I'm pleased and would recommend this tablet.For what I paid:Build quality 5/5Screen 4/5Battery life 5/5Fire OS 4/5I've seen some bad reviews because people are expecting this to be an Android tablet. While Fire OS is built on Android, this tablet is fully built around Amazon's ecosystem. Do your research about using it for anything else before you buy.",,,,
7,Good tablet except for the sound volume I like the text to speech feature.  The volume from the dual speakers is bad.  I have to use an external speaker or ear buds to move away from tablet & hear what is being said.  The tablet is sturdy & easy to use.,,,,
8,,,I still prefer my old 7 HDX Amazon hasn't made a high res smaller Fire since the 7 HDX. I purchased this new one liking the idea of the wireless charging cradle. It's nice enough but why can't you have text to speech work with the screen off on these new Kindles. The screen if not physically being touched turns off after a half hour at the highest setting you can set it for even in on the charger and that has to be with the screen on. So if I have I use text to speech which I like to do if working on other things. My old  7 HDX has the 1920x1080 resolution of the 10 inch but I can keep listening with the screen off even if using bluetooth to listen in the car. The main reason I looked again at new Fires was Amazon stopped supporting Audible on it. :(,,
9,,My Favorite Kindle! I use this kindle to read of course but also like a tablet. I also watch videos & listen to music. I have all the sizes of Kindle but this one is my favorite. Not too big & not too small. And I love the sound on it.,,,

2,,,,"Fire HD 8 Plus kindle Can't use my Amazon Music Unlimited account on this new device. On Saturday, spent about an hour or so going through the things I hsd already tried. But I tried again. Still did not work. We can't get Amazon Music Unlimited to work on any of our devices.Her last suggestion was to put it back to factory default. I don't want to lose my stuff and figure out how to find it. Tech support said there was a problem-shouldn't be mine.We have tried resetting to factory defaults to see if it worked. Amazon music was working then. But Amazon music was not working on any of our devices.Well we then decided we decided to keep it. But now the navigation bars are gone. On Amazon Forum, other people are having same problem. They were told to restart and reset to defaults.We are not doing this anymore. We're buying a Samsung Android device, and not from Amazon.My Kindle is a Fire 10 and I couldn't get music to work either. I've had it a while and didn't want to do it, but I did and I am still trying to restore apps and data I had on it. But Amazon music did work. In chatting with one tech support, they said they had a problem with it and to just reboot. Only restoring to facte default would work. Since it was their problem, I shouldn't have to go through this hassle.",

Other than that major flaw, the tablet is great, noticeably better in many ways compared to my old Fire HD8 generation 8. This new 10 has quite a few improvements.But I won't be happy if I can't get this incorrect location issue fixed.  I don't want to forever have Alexa giving me the weather for Park City, TN instead of my actual location.  :(  Anyone know how to fix this problem?  Hello Amazon, is anybody there?  This one flaw turns a tremendous tablet into a terrible tablet.  I will update if & when I solve the problem.",,

This will keep him busy,  to take on his Chemotherapy days, while he is waiting.  He enjoys his games. I ordered one for myself. I'm so looking forward for it. For what I paid. Well worth the money. The only thing that I was unhappy with is when it was delivered No ring on my doorbell. It was thrown on my flower bed. Like the paperboy used to to throw papers! Not to happy! It's a expensive Fire HD 8. For it be be tossed!!",,,

2,,"this is the best thing I got for Christmas I had a Kindle years ago but had not been using it for some time. This new one offers so much more I now don't use my computer very much. I love the versatility, the screen is great and I fall asleep with someone reading to me every night. Then there is Alexa who connects me to whatever I ask for so that I don't have to do a thing to get right back tomy book at exactly the place I stopped listening.  I have never been so spoiled.",,,

5,,,"An ok media consumption device with some WiFi annoyances. The HD 8 plus is better than the old HD8, though I would not say by much. I still think it's worse than the HDX 7 from years ago for screen and performance but that tablet isn't supported anymore.The HD 8 plus is an ok media consumption device and not much else. Would be nice if YouTube tv was supported but most other streaming services are.Like every fire tablet I've used (HDX 7, HD 8) it has some WiFi issues. It will not connect to SSIDs that are set for o not broadcast. Even if you temporarily set the SSID to broadcast (that trick worked on the old HD 8 and HDX 7). Not sure why amazon tablets have difficulty with this.Support is generally unhelpful with the wifi issue. They have a script for it but it's low hanging fruit only, pretty much reiterates what anyone would try first anyway.",,
6,"Fire HD 8 Plus tablet - great value The Fire HD 8 Plus tablet is a great value for the price and use as a simple table and eReader. I pretty much only use it for video chatting, reading eBooks, checking email, watching movies/tv through apps, and when cooking or meal prepping. I got the wireless charging stand, which really helps for hands free usage (Ie. cooking and meal prepping).",,,,

I enjoy Alexa for several things, and I purchased a case with hand strap which I love.  The tablet has worked wonderfully and was easy to setup and use.

2,"Not Quite What I Expected in a Tablet This is my first tablet, so I could be ignorant about what is possible with it so keep that in mind.  My complaint is that it seems to be limited to only connecting to Amazon products.  I should be able to connect it to any blue tooth speaker I want to and not only Amazon products.",,,,
3,"Much better iteration I’ve been using Fire tablets for a few years and I’ve found this year’s to be definitely more fluid and speedy mostly because of the 3 GB RAM. I also like the form factor this time. However, the screen quality remains mediocre which is acceptable given the product’s price. Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with the device and it makes for a good ereader and media device paired with Alexa for home automation.",,,,

For future reference, I wish there was a compromise 9 incher.",,,

IT RUNS FASTER, IS A LITTLE LIGHTER IN WEIGHT, AND CHARGES QUICKER.I DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY LIBRARY BOOKS AND PURCHASED BOOKS TO LET ME READ THEM, BUT I CALLED AMAZON AND THEY CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.

1,,,"Bad camera location I use a Kindle to read books.  I hold it vertically.  If you want your controls and plugs at the top, that places your rear camera in the upper left, and front-facing camera midway down the left side (and covered by your hand). This presents problems for cover manufacturers. So far, all of them seem to hinge the cover on the right edge (when held vertically), and for a right-hander like me, this is very awkward.Compared to my previous Fire 8 HD, the battery lasts much longer, but I don't see any real improvements in speed. I do like the form factor, as it feels more ""book-like"". A good first tablet (except as noted above), but other than better battery life, not a major upgrade.",,
2,,"Love it Like the battery life.  My old kindle I had to charge it every day.  It is also lighter which make reading easier. I only occasionally read books on my really old kindle.  I've already read several books on my new one. The bigger screen is also great.  Money well spent!!  PS I am a older person who is definitely challenged with technology, but with the help of your technicians and the easy to follow directions on the kindle itself I was able to do everything I wanted.Thank you Amazon techs!!",,,
3,Tablets I bought 2 of theses tablets one for each of my kids  they love them big time  it’s nice for kids age 13 and 11  my kids play lots of games I had to set it up for them but it was worth it glad I ordered there,,,,

5,Kindle Fire HD8 Plus Review This is our Third Kindle.It works great. The problem was things didn't transfer well from the old account/Kindle. We talked with Customer service. It got more but only about 2/3rds of the stuff. Last time it transferred without a problem. Otherwise it's a nice unit. Also you should offer a case for it as part of the original purchase.Thank You,,,,
6,,,,,"Cheap This is my second Fire: my first one had a cracked screen, which I attributed to a rambunctious puppy. However, this one fell all of 18 inches, and the screen just shattered. Multiple fractures all the way across. So that's 2/2 ruined with normal use. I've had a lot of handheld touchscreen devices, and I've never seen such fragility. It does explain the short warranty period.The screen also picked up an amazing lot of scratches in the five months I've had it, for something I leave at home, on a futon.On other aspects, the lack of customization is problematic for an Android user, and the launcher lags on basic functions: the ""For You"" screen can take a minute to load, which is just unbelievably slow. The display itself is fine, but doesn't do well in bright light.I do like the integration with the Fire stick. But Amazon seems to have decided to make a cheap, non-durable, disposable tablet. I guess it's a case of being what you pay for.I do think it's interesting that cases for these increase the cost 30%. The necessity of a case makes it a lot less of a good deal."
7,,,"Sounds like the inside is burning Overall, I am happy with the new Fire.  But, it always sounds like it is shorting out and about to catch fire.  Every time I pick it up I wonder if this will be the last time, or if it will burst into flames in my hands.",,
8,"Is ok After using an iPad for many years, I thought I would switch to a easier annual purchase however the screen delay between switching apps and slow response is noticeable but not unusable.  The quality is amazing and the ease of annual upgrade replacement is exception.  Had I not been use to the speed of the iPad I would definitely recommend this device",,,,
9,,Genial Esta genial para mis niños,,,
0,,Birthday Gift I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter's birthday and she loves it!,,,
1,,,,,"Lacks  Connectivity The HD  8"" tablet is  a  great  stand alone, watch videos read  books, and  surf web  tablet.. So why did I rate it 2? Because it has  no connectivity.. You can  not  connect  it to  an HDMI Display  via its US b type c Port. That's  just ridiculous in today's  Hi-tech world.  If they won't make it so you can connect by USB, then at least include a  micro HDMI port. Amazon is so close to a  perfect tablet here, but the  connectivity issue  just tanks it for me.additionally OTG is  flakey at best.I realize that  these  two issues  really aren't what its intended to be as  tablet, however, They are important enough that it needs  to be  clearly noted.DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET FOR CONNECTING TO TV /DISPLAY etc by HDMI"
2,,,b I wish it was more like the regular tablet,,
3,"Good tablet for the right price It is a good tablet for a good price,battery actually last a decent amount of time on a single charge,screen quality is better than fire 7. My eye sight is not what it use to be, the Audible service allows me to listen to a book vs straining my eyes to read.",,,,
4,"Very nice device, but want more apps I bought this to replace my Samsung Android tablet. I got this as it has 3 GB RAM which makes a positive difference.  I like the device very much, especially the Amazon ecosystem integration. However, I wish I was able to use the Google Play store as the number of apps is lacking compared to what I am used to. I will keep this and use it for some time, though.",,,,
5,"Itvis incompatible with some popular streaming video apps. One big disappointment was the inability to install many apps related to streaming video: Peacock, youtubetv, roku, etc. Also my favorite VPN, PUREVPN could not be installed. For these reasons I have sent it back and will spend some more money to buy an Ipad mini.",,,,
6,,"Great buy affordable price I like this item, this is is a well made iPad and can stand up to the more popular brands, that cost a lot more. I like that you can buy a (S/D) card if you need more storage space. Screen quality is clear. Battery life is good, and touch screen is great. I have recommended this iPad to others and they like it very much,  plus the added features like movies games and silk.",,,
7,,"You can't ask for more.... This is my second 8"" fire tablet. I pretty much wore the other one out. This one has a little more power and speed. The price is unbeatable.",,,
8,"Could have been perfect. If they would allow Google Play to be a native app. Instead you have to go through a process to install that is not enjoyable. Some apps from Google Play still don't work like expected like Zillow or any other app that requires it to use Google maps. Not critical to enjoy the tablet, but makes it inconvenient. Still great tablet. The speed and memory are unbeatable. That extra RAM really helps in performance.",,,,
9,,"Works so well for me. Once I got a cover, to close it , and to help the tablet to stand and be held easier, it is so perfect.",,,
0,,,Disappointed I purchased this when my older one died expecting it to be easy to transfer my purchased books.  I am Nor computer illerate but can't transfer,,
1,"Old cords don't work It's annoying that this new Fire does not use the same cords as the old ones.  It means that I have to buy additional ones to make sure that I can always charge it.  I liked having extra cords in the car, at my daughters, etc.  My Kindle is always with me.",,,,
2,books/games Yes all my games transferred over but not how far I was on my games. I have to start all over but it is worth it as I love the looks on my new Kindle,,,,
3,,,It's very slow! It's slow and hard to find things on it.  Trying to find good games on it is worthless.  I wish my Fire 7 didn't poop out...I loved that.Just not happy with this.,,
4,,Always notice battery life that's important Like the screen nice size battery life pretty good,,,
5,Ehh It’s great. I just hate that it doesn’t work with graphics designing. So as much as I desire to keep it for myself I will be force give it to my children. Not very google friendly.,,,,
6,,"It's easy to handle and works great! It's everything I wanted.  I got it to replace my 10yr. old Kindle.  The quality of the screen picture is great and the battery life is long.  If you get this , you will love it.",,,
7,Hard to use I use the Fire primarily for reading and for that it is very good. However the tablet does not come with any instructions making it very hard to figure out how to use the Fire. There should be an instruction manual available or a video to guide you through the various features and how to use them.,,,,
8,,"Perfect size I had the 7th generation 10"" for several years and it was so cumbersome - too tall and too wide to just hold in your hands like a reader. The 8"" is perfect for reading and surfing and even typing messages. Same screen quality as far as I can tell. Very happy I decided to trade in.",,,
9,"Compact & clear. A gift to my husband.  He hasn't finished setting it up, (too many other things he had to do), but it looks like a good buy. Will let you know.",,,,

1,"Great Entertainment Tablet Great inexpensive tablet. Works very well if you have Prime. Helps organizing entertainment sources. Not the best at anything, but the Best option for the price, especially if you have little ones using. Kid profiles take to whole new level at any price. Tablet with case is rugged and reliable. Would recommend for everyone sharing tablet or concerned with price. I have dropped it several times while using. No damage to report.",,,,
2,,Love them very much. Love mine.  I bought my sister one she is very difficult to please. Guess what? she really likes hers too.😃I was holding my breath as she went through it. Cannot wait to get my free cover. My sister got hers ready and sent the cover out changed her mind.  She canceled had to pay for the cover.. They sent her a full refund and took in the order that she wanted. She is going to order 2 more for her grand daughters.one huge thank you for great customer services. I'm very happy. And so is my fussy sister.L,,,
3,,"A ""Muscular"" Little Tablet! The FIRE HD 8 PLUS is a real step up from the Fire HD 8 tablet. Even with serious use, it only needs to be recharged after  four or more days! The picture is crisp, the sound very clear, the touchscreen is nicely reactive. The tablet feels very solid, and with 128 MB Micro card, it has plenty of storage. The software on the HdD 8 PLUS is very comfortable and straight-forward to use; I prefer it to the iPad I inherited from my Grandson.",,,
4,Changes to Fire I got this as a replacement for my previous Fire.  It is mostly the same but the function buttons have been rearranged & the power port is a different type.  I hated the different placement of the buttons at first because I was used to where they were before,,,,
5,,"All you need in one tablet. Size is good, fits into my bag. Not heavy, great screen quality.",,,
6,,,,"Worst tablet ever made by Amazon? Yes! No one actually used this tablet before placing it on the market. They found the worst possible places to put the lighting sensor and the on/off switch. You cannot hold the tablet during game play without hitting the on/off button. It's precisely where you place your right handin landscape mode. They could not have found worse places if they tried! The light sensor is placed where you have no choice when holding the tablet but to cover it. That is also extremely problematic, even senseless.If the tablet had not been bought at a very good price, these would very much be fatal flaws. Given the price, they are more VERY irritating and reasons to only consider returning the tablet.The rotational control might fix the problems but the tablet will not orient properly if turned upside down. They stupidity placed limitations on rotation. Fortunately, I have an app which forces rotation and both the lighting sensor problem and on/off switch are (only) a bit less irritating. However, these common sense mistakes may have me eventually return the tablet. I guarantee you'll have the same irritating problems I experience.Although the tablet does not have Google Play as system software, it's easily added. If it was not possible to add Google, that and the above issues would make the tablet almost completely unusable and worthless except for reading.Those things said, and they are all but fatal design errors, I would have returned the tablet within 2 hours of getting it but for the prime day pricing. Any good about the tablet is almost zeroed out by the sensor and power switch placements. You have been warned. It would never be worth full price with such mistakes. Caveat emptor.",
7,Nice tablet I like the tablet a lot. The screen size and clarity is fine. I never had a product with Alexa and I like that service also. The only thing I dislike is I still get ads and I paid extra because the item was listed I wouldn't get them. But the tablet is great.,,,,
8,,"I love it! Much better than my older Fire 8! I bought this because my very heavily used 3-year-old Fire 8 was having issues! It's had much use, especially for downloaded purchased books and library books in addition to Internet use. I am extremely pleased with the larger amount of storage and cordless charging (which even works well with a protective case). I'll really enjoy using it this fall and winter while I read in front of the fireplace.",,,
9,Great speed I really like the speed of this Kindle.  The HD gives a great picture.  However the thing I really dislike is the amount of ads!,,,,
0,It’s more difficult to figure out. But I am used to it now!. I use this to read. I do not want Alexa on this device but cannot get it to stop bugging me to sign up. Other than that it’s good. Hard to get used to because my last fire was fairly old.,,,,
1,Good value Good value for me.Took books off iPad to put on the Fire.Kindle workings take a little getting used to as different than iPad.Lighter than iPad so easier to hold and read..Preferred my books in colour as opposed to kindle reader..Reduced requirement for new iPad I think .Seems well made and charging made easier thought at extra cost for stand.All in all very happy with this for the modest price....Paul Bruyea,,,,
2,"Great product that needs some fine-tuning yet... Pros: fast enough, lots of options/apps, good storage capabilities!Cons: freetime not that great for my child! Visual overload makes it hard for her to find what she is looking for....

7,"Fast, good screen, but sound volume is subpar Much improved from my previous 5th Generation. The extra gigabyte of memory makes this HD 8 Plus decently fast, perfectly comparable to the 2019 HD 10 despite having only 4 processors.Negative: sound volume. I don't seem to be able to make it louder, even as loud as my old 5th Gen. I'm still researching it, but for now it's only 4 stars.",,,,

9,"volume and on/off buttons are too close and difficult to determine by touch All in all I like the tablet.  My major complaint is that the volume buttons are very shallow, close together, and right next to the on/off button.  If I were to design that portion, the volume buttons would be in a different place and more definable by touch.",,,,
0,,,"Newest version of the Kindle reader software is pathetic Love the tablet, the newest version of the reader software is horrible. Okay, reader software, as the name says one expects to use it to READ with, right? Well some mental midget at Amazon can't seem to figure this basic concept out. The idiot has changed the user interface so that, it opens to a ""Home"" tab instead of the book you are reading. The settings are buried, what few there are. The idiotic Home tab wastes your time loading ""recommendations"" that are of course mostly inaccurate. If I wasn't so heavily invested in Kindle (been using one for close to 15 years), I would be sending this unit back.

This product is a nice little power-house that helps make believe you have a much more expensive product with features built in that are included in a more expensive model. It will win you over!!!

Well worth the price over the basic HD8, much snappier than the regular versions.Sideload Google play and you have a full fledged tablet.The only negative with this is that apparently they decided to not allow exFAT as a file format now.

 I haven't had this longer than a week and it's already ""not charging"".1.) I let it charge overnight2.) I tried the exact power cord and adapter that came with this3.) I tried different outlets around my apartment4.)... (The only thing I haven't tried is diving into the developer options and finding a way to remove this ""designed obsolescence"" feature in this software)I shouldn't have to do that. I don't appreciate them pushing that wireless charger dock onto the customers. This wireless charging dock limits the amount of covers the customer can use. Charging should not require an additional part to be plugged in to your device to work, which also limits where the customer can charge their tablet. I find this sleazy and borderline offensive.As I'm writing this, the percentage went down 1% while plugged in (see video)",,
4,,"Worth it for the Qi charging The Fire HD 8 is a great little tablet for surfing the web, watching movies on the go, Kindle reading, and whatever other light activities you want to do.  It's my personal device of choice whenever I'm traveling.  At home, I use the show mode and have fun with Alexa.  I was fine with the previous generation's performance and the base model of the current generation, but the option for Qi charging pushed me to get the Plus, and it was absolutely worth it.  Highly recommend this go anywhere, do anything machine.",,,
5,"ire HD 8 Plus  is improved model Fire HD 8 Plus is improved over the previous 7"" model that i had for a couple years. Much faster processor/navigating around. Overall. not bad tablet for what i use it for, checking emails, watch a couple video/movies on the go. Some internet browsing.  better than pulling out the laptop.",,,,
6,,"Great tablet for the price Fire tablet was on sale and had Amazon gift points on my account, so this purchase was free. Awesome!",,,
7,,Kindle fire 8 plus rocks! Love how much faster this is than the fire 7 5th gen was. Still have some hesitations in my games. Very sensitive to my finger being near the screen. There is a device dashboard that I have been unable to turn off so it opens whenever I touch the bottom left corner.  This is a little heavier than the fire 7 so I bought the case/stand for it. Charging cord is a little short so I purchased a longer one that is 3 ft. Love this fire!,,,
8,,"compact, fast and easy It's much faster than my OLD iPad.  Clear and sharp picture.  Still figuring out how to do everything but no complaints.  I like it",,,
9,Decent Very decent.  Was a little surprised at how slow internet can be....but remembering the price and that its basically a Kindle...  For reading books....its good.  Just have to realize what it's meant for.  Its not an iPhone lol.,,,,
0,,"Of all my tablets, this is my favorite. Screen is great, sound is phenomenal, battery is awesome. I did the google hack on it and now enjoy all the apps I want. I cannot complain about this tablet at all. I thought the 8"" screen would be too small for my purposes but turns out its perfect. Oh and dont get me started on the wireless charging, no more breaking the charge ports? YES!!! My applications for this tablet will be mostly automotive diagnostics and PCM code writing, lately though its been tv watching when the kids have the real tv. Good purchase.",,,
1,,"Exactly what I needed! Like it a lot, use primarily for reading books.",,,
2,,"Nice step up from Fire 7 I bought this for my husband, upgrading from the Fire 7 tablet and he is very pleased with it. He uses it primarily for reading books downloaded from the library. He also reads the news on it. It is faster and has much better resolution than the 7. The price is right too!",,,

4,,"Easy to use and easy to charge. It’s a wonderful little tablet that meets all my requirements for a sharp, light, easy to use, instrument for games and reading novels, which is why I picked it.

There is no volume at all, even with headphones and even turned to max. Additionally we tried to download sound boosters but the situation is the same. Out of any 4-5 albums attempted to be played on this device, or recording of any description, I have to literally hold it to my ear to get anything!  Maybe I just have a dud, but then my husband apparently just has a dud too? We purchased ours last August, and I'm a bit sorry I didn't return them when I could.",,

I did try to read articles on the internet, but so far I have not figured out how to enlarge the written content of articles - I have not tried using the games yet, whiich I thoroughly enjoyed with my Kindle 7, where the games were bigger and easier to see.  The one drawback of the 8 plus is that it is smaller than  the 7, which I am used to.  Hoping I will get used to the 8 plus.",,

4,,Took a minute to figure out how to move adult apps to the child's profile I've owned 3 now and no real problems other than putting too many apps on it slowing out down. I can't get out back where it was but it still works fine,,,
5,Bien para el precio. Cumple con su trabajo. Tablet gama media que cumple con sus funciones. El App Store de Amazon es muy limitado y muchas apps no funcionan bien. Para tener 3GB de RAM parece tener menos. Spotify se pega mucho y no es tan fluida.,,,,
6,All giod Kindle is fine just thought i ordered the plum instead of slate. Moving things over from the old kindle account was a bit of a pain. Not everything transferred. Other than those issues i am happy with the device.,,,,
7,,Would order Again Would order Again,,,
8,,,"Great I really like it . Faster than the 10 I had, but the 10 would at least stay locked in horizontal position.So my only PROBLEM ... It will not stay, even when locked, in horizontal mode.  It's annoying.",,
9,Solid four stars I bought this tablet for someone that is not tech savvy and has very simple needs. The price is excellent compared to most tablets and the 3GB RAM helps an otherwise slow tablet. The main reason I didn't give it 5 stars were all the ads that are constantly cluttering the experience. I would have happily paid a bit more to have an ad free interface.,,,,

I have an old Kindle that loses its charge if it is not plugged in, but I keep it so that I can still play Suburbia, Scrabble, and a few other irreplaceable games.  Scrabble is not replaceable by the clone games because they have terrible bots that cannot beat me. No challenge at all.  Do you guys not realize how extremely important it is for people to be able to keep using their stuff on their next Kindle?  I am really fed up.",,

3,,This model well beats my Fire 7 I got tired of 'tap and wait' internet with my Fire 7 so upgraded to this 3 GB RAM model. Couldn't be more pleased.  It browses like a real tablet should whereas the 7 w/ 1 GB RAM is only suited to play music and read books. I added Google Play via the well published hack so can run Android apps aplenty.,,,
4,,Love it! Best tablet I have had as yet!,,,
5,Does a great job for data consumption for the price Have not been successful at downloading music to add on SD card.  Not to big of a deal and I'm sure I will get it to work at some point.,,,,
6,Good deal for the money For the price it’s a very good deal. Don’t expect an iPad though which is several hundred dollars more. It’s a bit slower and the picture quality isn’t as good. There are a lot of apps available but don’t expect google play or App Store.,,,,
7,"Easy to set up The tablet works well for what I intended to use it for and was easy to set up. My only issue is I can’t open my Kindle books, I have to download and open from kindle app on my phone first, don’t understand why I need to do this.",,,,
8,,,"Disappointment in Amazon in not correcting on going issue! I bought this fire after having three of the HD10 break where the cord for charger plugs into the unit. I bought the three in just under three yrs, one was a warranty replacement the other two out if my pocket. This is only model that has a wireless charging dock, this makes NO sense to me!!!! Amazon has to know there is a weakness in the connecting point, I do NOT believe I'm the only customer that's had this issue. So disappointed in Amazon though I basically like everything about Kindle except for this one defect. So far the wireless charging dock seems to be the perfect solution unfortunately not available on other Kindle models. Shame on Amazon!!!",,
9,,,"It's different, for sure. The size, although not that different, does make a big difference to me. In having a hard time adjusting to it.  Many of the covers open to the right instead of to the usual left (due to the location of the camera lens), which has me turning the device again and again.  The on/off buttons have moved to next to the volume, why?  This is my 6th fire HD, and  it's just difficult to acclimate to.  I purchased the larger processor your additional speed, and I see no difference.  All in all, I should have remained with my older (2018) fire HD.",,
0,,,,"UPDATE: How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways I've been a Nook reader for years and it finally died. Barnes & Noble made a big mistake by discontinuing the Nook, it was a great e-reader. That's why I bought the HD Fire 8. There is no comparison. The minute you open the Nook, you get a tutorial and you can start reading immediately. Open up the Fire and you get ads. The Nook has a feel-able button so you know where it is and which way is up. With the HD Fire you have to feel around to find the buttons which are small and on the side. The Nook came with a great crossword puzzle selection, the HD Fire 8 has none and you have to download from the App store and they are terrible. When reading with the Nook, you can see the time, the page number, how many pages left, and a slider you can use to go to any page. Fire? Nope. I see ""6 minutes left in book."" What the heck does that mean? To see page numbers (but not the time), you have to click on the page.  With the Nook, if you want the definition of a word, all you had to do is click on the word. If that feature exists in the Fire, I don't know about it. I truly hate this thing and would return it in a minute if Nook was still in business. And finally, all those features in the Fire, like News, Amazon music, Photos--most people use their phones. There's more but this review is long enough!!UPDATE: I forgot to mention that the charger cable is unique to Kindle and you can't use any other. Very annoying.",
1,"Fire HD 8 Review My son gave me the HD Fire for Christmas.  I have enjoyed uisiung it for Netflix and Prime movies (very fast), Zoom meetings, FB, but I know it will do much more..  Very pleased so far, even if it doesn't have the battery life of my Kindle - duhh!",,,,
2,"Not enough memory. For a technically advanced device, the memory specifications are woefully deficient.  The screen freezes when I do nothing more than scroll to read my college textbooks.  This is unacceptable.  It's a book for Pete's sake.  Everything else is fine.",,,,
3,Nice tablet for the price. Thought I might have regretted the 8-inch version and not getting a larger one. 8 inch version seems perfect for me. Couple of complaints are the battery seems to run down pretty quickly  and the outside buttons are pretty hard to see. Working around getting google apps to work is a pain as well. Otherwise I'm happy with the purchase.,,,,
4,The price is right. Excellent value for most tasks. My old iPad mini getting out of date for newer apps. My only negative comment is that it doesn't come with Google apps. You have to go through a tricky process to get it installed. At any rate it's a good deal for the money..,,,,
5,,"I love it and enjoy using it the only problem is that it has changed so much from my last kindle, that I, as a technologically challenged older person, am having trouble doing much more that just using it as a reader.  I wish I had a paper of directions that I could keep referring to in order to find various sites and general directions.  I am not getting nearly enough of the benefits from the new kindle.",,,

8,,,,"Do not buy this one Let me say first of all this is not my first kindle. I am on #6. I started with the kindle just for reading and upgraded to the fire. My last one was the larger size because I use it for watching Netflix, prime … some emails but mainly reading. Unfortunately my battery didn’t hold the charge anymore so I decided to get a new one and went back to the smaller kindle. First it didn’t work so I called the kindle CSR Team nice lady but couldn’t walk me through because her words she does not read and could not see what I am looking at. Next person made me update my kindle but could not help me download my books. At this point I also mentioned to the lady that my last  kindle was a my kindle 5 now I am at kindle 4 hmmm. Also downloading a book now takes forever, never took that long before. I called again and a was told to go on the website to download my books, better but still not 100%. I also explained the download time and was told it must be a bigger book, basically no help. Never with any of my kindles did I have these issues. I will call one more time because I love the kindle and hope they can fix it this time.",
9,,"So far so good I use this mostly for the Kindle app, as I read every day, instead of watching TV. I have had this for a month and so far no complaints, it suits my purposes just fine.

I have a 11"" laptop, so a 10"" Fire is too big for easy portability.Perfect for reading, videos, streaming, and general web surfing.I purchased a screen protector and a serious protective case, kid case as pictured.

3,,,"Worth its discounted price, wish Amazon would release a better screen Its well worth its price on Prime Day discount, especially the HD 8 Plus, since it has 3 GB RAM instead of 2 GB on the regular HD 8. Coming from a 2014 HDX 7, the HD8's screen is inferior. Its ok to watch movies,  but its not 1080p. I also find it takes time to display the home screen icons when woken up. Its also inconsistent, videos will sometimes not play, instead showing a blank screen while audio plays. Amazon sent a replacement but the issue remains. Overall, well worth its discount but not its full price. Great battery life.",,
4,Screen moves when holding at the bottom It is aggravating when reading and holding the fire by the bottom the page will jump up or move to another page.  It makes is less fun to read from the Fire when you have to continually have to stop and move the page back to where it should be.,,,,
5,The good and the bad! Sound quality and volume has gone down with each model and this one is the worst yet.  Almost no volume.  The power switch is in a terrible space and you are shutting off the unit all the time trying to hold on to the tablet.  The memory is much better than the old units and its worth the additional money to get the model without offers.,,,,

I'm now able to use the real YouTube app and have full Chromecast connectivity on all the apps that offer & websites that offer it. Got the protection plan, and am making payments on it that Amazon offers.",,,
2,Good choice over 7 inch fire This tablet is much improved over the 7 inch fire tablet. Processor is faster. Screen is better. The latest interface which is common to all fire tablets is in my opinion much harder to use and understand than the older interface. Alexa responses are well done.,,,,

I have 4 stars on battery life as you do have to recharge often but that is probably to be expected in this low price range. You can side load Google Play Store and have access to the apps in the store. This is in addition to the Amazon world and apps. Added a micro SD card to bump the storage.

6,,,,"Terrible The one I received was too glitchy. I only had it 1 day and already had to reset it to factory settings because the keyboard kept minimizing, it would pop up then go off the screen. After I reset the device it started working again. The wifi is absolutely pathetic. It has a hard time connecting and when it does it is slow as molasses. I didn't think of it till I got it but in landscape view the power button it horribly placed and I constantly hit it by accident. The app store is beyond pathetic as it seems to focus on kiddy games and this device just shoves them in your face. Its small but relatively heavy for its size and the screen is small. I have an aged Samsung Gal Tab 8A and that screen is bigger, more wider. My Samsung runs slow (its old) so that was my reason to replace it but the new Fire HD runs just as slow. There is a definite lag from typing and it doing the task I asked it to do as if it was a lagged internet connection. Yeah, I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone.",
7,,"Worth it I like how affordable it is. Faster then I expected. Great resolution. What I don’t like is having to press the button to wake the screen instead of just touching the screen. I don’t like the added cost to remove adds, more of a Amazon complaint than tablet.

In fact the 2011 Kindle is still my go-to machine for new purchases, as it has the fastest and most reliable downloads.

There are very few good apps in the store.Also, they need to come with a screen protector. I've gone through several due to a cracked screen.They also need to remove the little house in the bottom left corner, because you will most likely hit it every five seconds and go to that screen (if you are right-handed).I'm just not a fan of their last several updates that changed everything around.",,

It will work fine and then tell you there is no sd card.  After owning about 7 Kindles over the last 6 years I believe they are an inferior product that needs to be improved.

Now I did read that if you play games or watch movies/shows you might need to charge it more often. As for reading, it will be weeks before you need to charge it and that is with using it everyday. Couldn't be happier.",,,

They don't seem to hold up when you have to plug them into charge and the one I had was barely a year old but I use them all the time.  Bought a protective cover for new one but cannot use it with the dock charger and not worth it to try to return it so I guess its a buyer beware deal!  All that said I really like this new tablet!",,,

0,,"A really good small tablet I had a 10"" Kindle Fire which I loved, but lost it and decided smaller and lighter might be better. First the good, the screen is very good, and the battery life is outstanding.  About the only negative for me is that it's  a bit smaller than I anticipated. You should also keep in mind that it is a Kindle, not a generic Android tablet. Some apps are not available for it, many actually. However for reading, browsing the web, watching Netflix and using Amazon Prime it's great.",,,
1,,"Best Kindle Fire yet The newest Kindle Fire the 8HD Plus is very nice. I would recommend it to anyone that wants a very reliable, reasonably priced tablet.The only thing I could see that would improve the Kindle Fire 8 HD Plus would be to allow it to work on the cell network.",,,
2,,"Really is better than the old 8"" tablet. I pre-ordered this tablet as the 8"" Fire tablet I had was too slow.  I then read some reviews that this new tablet was no faster than the old one.  After using the new tablet, I am satisfied that it is appreciably faster than the old one.  Sound is very good, as is the screen.  If you want a better 8"" tablet, you will have to pay at least 3 times the price of this one.  For the money, this is a great tablet, and I would recommend it.",,,
3,,,,,"Faulty product I've had several Kindle fire tablets, and have been very happy with the product. When the charging port on my last one failed, I found this HD + on sale, and was thrilled. Unfortunately, this tablet is not the same quality as the others. I don't know if it is the change from the Kindle OS to a Microsoft browser that is the problem, but I find that the internet is laggy, or pages fail to load at all. Games stutter, I get constant ""no connection"" notifications when I am obviously online  - I mean, if the ads are loading, I have an internet connection, right? None of the previous tablets I've had have had this issue. I am constantly having to reboot, and often I just give up rather than fight it. I cannot recommend this tablet, and I am so disappointed."

When it is a very good tablet for the money, I found the picture quality not as good as Nexus 7, it's size too large to comfortably hold with one hand and the Amazon App store is too limiting. Will be returning and using Nexis 7 until the next Fire Tablet is released.",,,,

I should have to the SamsungWatching videos on amazon prime - greatViewing things on kindle -  great.Stay in the Amazon lane - great!Anything outside the Amazon lane - crap.The OS version is a bit dated looking and function, the apps you would want to use are unavailable on Amazon's store or if they exist they are OLD as dirt and don't work with current services. Telegram isn't available, Plus messenger is too old, Blink camera app barely works, it's behind, ring nope not even going to work. Devs seem to put Amazon Fire apps on the backburner as a ""maybe we will backport it later"" or it seems ""back port it once and never update again"".  I look for an app I use on my phone, ""hey this app would be great on a tablet screen, not available.Half the time Alexa voice feature doesn't work at all saying it isn't connected to the internet or it is slow and competes with my tap in the same room, doesn't detect nearest device and play election well."
8,Good for internet I've never owned a Fire Tablet and I probably shouldn't have had high expectations.  It works for internet and e-mail etc... but the screen doesn't react as quickly as I would have hoped.  It lags when going from one screen to another so that is a little disappointing.,,,,

This new one is easy to set up and it transfers all her information almost automatically. This tablet is faster and she absolutely LOVES the wireless charging. The wireless charging is so easy to use and it works right through the Fire HD case we bought. As always we love these Fire HDs.",,,

I have a lot of issue with voice view on this model. Yes, I uses Voice View to navigate on the device.  Amazon accessibility team need to fix the hick-up with voice view on this device. It's very annoying, I can't swipe smoothly because of the hick-ups with Voice View.  My older kindle fire model worked better than this one.  I was hoping to use this device to watch Netflix and other  services.  All I do with it for now is read my books with it.",,

And then I can take it with me, and still do things like usefully edit Google Docs/sheets and play games like Plague.Big enough to be read, small enough to just tuck into my waistband and go.",,,
5,"Good with one major problem. It is definitely an improvement over the last version. The app store is still lacking. I wanted to use the Libby library app bit of course it is not to be found.  The Ovetdrive app is OK but buggy. One thing I don't understand is the fact that the Amazon shopping app does not work. I do most of my shopping on my fire, but the  app freezes.",,,,
6,,"Exactly what I expected This is definitely an upgrade from my older fire hd. I might be weird but all I use it for is reading books and comics, the 3gb of ram helps tremendously with loading large comics. I don't know if this is a new feature, but narration never worked on my older fire, so it has been nice switching between reading a book at home then being able to listen to it on my commute to work. Over all I feel that this tablet is worth the price, and does everything I expected well.",,,
7,,"Great little device but 4 not 5 star The little screen is cool. Very close to Apple IPad functionality but do t even think about using it for photo’s.  Just not that great on resolution.  However watching a movie acceptable.  Great for zoom, long battery life and can get cool wireless dock stand. For $150 its really a pretty awesome unit.  A note...This unit may have Ghost Touch. Not a good thing. Means you type a login and it switches screens. Research shows a display issue. I sent mine back awaiting a new replacement. Hoping new one fixes issue!",,,

0,Perfect size to keep in the car! I use the fire more as a Kindle than anything else.  I have used paperwhite and an oasis and couldn't deal with the black and white so the fire it is.

0,"Trouble with internet connection.... If you play any games that require internet connection...for instance Mergical, Lilly's Garden or other merging/popping games. The Kindle HD Plus loses its connection to the internet frequently and its annoying. But otherwise it is a fine machine.",,,,

2,,,"Good tablet but freezes up.on game playing I did not buy from your site.  I ended up having to try 3different of these Fire tablets as they do have a MAJOR problem with freezing up when playing games.  1st one would freeze up constantly, 2nd is the one I kept and 3rd was about like the 2nd.  Mine still freezes up, but not as often as the 1st.  It is a nice tablet though, fast speed,  clear screen and Alexa usage if you want.  I would recommend except be warned you will have a screen freezing up when playing games where you have to turn off for few secs then turn back on.",,
3,Quality video and responsive touchscreen Overall quality of the equipment is very impressive for the price. Lots of bloatware make spending with the parent company way too easy.  Beware of introductory offers that must be cancelled before charges accrue.  Works great for prime video on the go or Amazon shopping.  I have not done any extensive testing of the camera. Love the usb-c turbocharging!,,,,

I can't begin to express how much easier it is to read a book on a tablet in bed than to hold and turn pages on a real book.  This is wonderful!  I am 76 years old and slowly learning ""new tricks""... Alexa is a trip!  And the Black Friday price was an amazing savings!",,,

9,,"Best in class I have been using the Fire HD 7 for several years now. I tried the Fire 7 which was a cheap downgrade of the HD 7, so the HD 8+ is a welcome addition to my Amazon  devices. The narrow  bezel allows an 8 inch HD screen with only a slight  increase in overall size. With Ql charging and micro SD slot and  usb-c, it is a best in class device.",,,
0,Finally acceptable Much more responsive than the previous Fires I have owned. They have finally squeezed enough ram and a good enough processor to read kindle books properly and to load more than one app without long load times. This is my forth fire tablet and is going with me everywhere. I love it.,,,,

My children thought I was reverting back to my ""gotta have"" childhood.  I have been upgrading and adding to my collection ever since then.  I have given away some of them for my mom, kids that need them for school projects, etc.  I will keep my excitement moving forward to keep an eye on the future developments of one of my favorite products..",,,

4,,,"When it's $50-70 it's worth it. Otherwise not. For a child to use, its fine. Would be frustrating for an adult to use on a constant basis. The custom amazon OS is terrible. It's a modified version of Android OS, so you can easily get APK files to have access to Google PlayStore.",,
5,,"Wifi speed/connection not great on device. My tablet a lot of times says it is not connected to wifi when it is connected. My wifi speed is more more than fast enough with other devices in my home but for some reason apps, ads and videos take a long time to load on this device only. I am guessing the hardware inside for apps and wifi on this device lacks the ability to handle higher speeds. I should have bought an ipad but they are so damn expensive so going to have to save up for one.",,,

The ads don't bother me. Just swipe them away.",,,

I will say that the battery life and the speed of thIs Kindle are definitely better than my previous one, however, I am not at all satisfied with this product, which is why I gave it only 3 stars. It does not notify me of messages when they come in, but every once in a while it updates and notifies me of several messages at once.  There have been numerous times that it won't load a page at all or just kicks me off entirely. My previous Kindle was much simpler to operate and settings were easier to understand. I am not a fan and may return to using my old Kindle 7.",,

4,,"Like the bigger screen size I like that you get more detail and a brighter color than the last Kindle I had. This one has a smaller ""dead edge"" around it so you get more screen without much larger size. It was pretty easy to move everything over, and didn't miss a day of gaming or reading. I like it!",,,
5,,,"Great except for reason below. I bought this for my wife because she had a previous version and I am an Amazon addict. She uses it almost exclusively for reading and it has a serious design flaw. Using the Kindle app, the font size increases by increments from very tiny to small and then a huge jump to too large. There are not enough incremental sizes. We are not the only ones to notice this. Also, the line spacing is too wide even on the smallest setting. I hope that these flaws are addressed in a firmware update. A slider would be an improvement over the +/- buttons.The settings on my mini ipad are much more flexible. Come on Jeff! Get with it:)",,
6,,Very nice product. Exactly what my wife wanted!,,,

8,,,,"If there was a negative Star I would give it From the moment I started using this device it was garbage.  Books would take forever to load or not load at all, so finally I called Amazon Kindle support and they tried everything and could not get it to work, so I sent it back to them for ""repair"".  It seemed better, for the first few weeks, then the bottom fell out again and books were slow loading and when you went to buy books everything was in Spanish and talk about the Amazon run around....its garbage, save yourself aggravation and time and buy something else...",

First one took a year to get so bad it was worthless, the second one 4 months. So when I saw that it had wireless charging now I thought I would give it another chance. So far so good. Mostly I use it to read by in bed. But sometimes watch movies on it. I hope this one holds up better than the last two.",,,

2,,Good value I really love my Kindle Fire 8. It keeps a long charge and I’ve already read several books on it. The size is very manageable to carry and I am able to download most apps as well. We just bought one for a family member for Christmas after they played with mine.  Got the screen protector and case for better protection. We also bought the warranty but did not receive paperwork so not sure how it works.,,,

4,,,"Same basic tablet I thought being 2020 and the 10th generation this would be much better than previous Fire tablets. It is really just the same. It’s fine for my 3 yr old but for me it’s very clunky. I like to use it for reading as well as occasionally other things. I use Goodreads daily, now ran by amazon, and the Goodreads app won’t work. It just keeps giving me errors. I wasted time chatting with customer support with no answer. The connection between the kindle reading and Goodreads is a big part of why I bought it. I also bought the wireless charging dock but the delivery date has been pushed back multiple times so I can’t say the wireless charging is worth it either. I preordered everything as a bundle and being brand new I expected to receive both items the day they came out.",,

The only bummer is that the apps we have paid for previously on the windows tab l ets aren't available unless you pay for them again on Amazon. They seem to work well, and I get alerted every time they download anything, even if it's a free item (which is all they download without getting permission first).",,,

You can’t beat that and for the price point it runs as if it’s bit more pricey than what it actually is.I recommend.",,,

1,,,"Amazon did not credit the price reduction, at first.... Unlike a few past instances, Amazon will no longer credit the buyer for a price reduction, even if the drop occurs within the 30 day return window.  In essence, you would have to order a new HD 8 Plus, at the sale price of $79.99, and return the unit that was $109.99.  I reiterate: this is a change in policy.I am not going to avail myself of the tedious procedure outlined above; the Tablet was a gift.Update: I am pleased to report that Amazon has reversed its position, in this case, and is refunding the price difference without my having to return the Kindle Fire; that, of course, was not an option.The actions of the Customer Service representative and his manager are commendable and surprising.  This is a proper resolution.",,

I really like simply setting the Kindle on the charging station rather than struggling to plug it in, and the battery charges right quick.

I mainly use it for reading books and using the text-to-speech to read them to me.  Audible books are awesome but sometimes they just cost too much so the text-to-speech is a great alternative for hands free reading.  It costs about the same as the kindle paper white but does a lot more if you need it.  This would be a perfect first device for someone.",,,

I can say, it was well worth it for entertainment on several 6-hour flights. Battery life seemed almost infinite. Watched several movies and listened to music the whole flight and never dipped below 75%. Bright screen, great resolution and color definition. Best tablet for the price.",,,
0,,Impressive So far I have really enjoyed my new kindle fire. The battery life has been excellent. The sound quality has improved over the last generation. The processor is quicker and pages load faster. The screen is crisp and while I would prefer a higher level of resolution for the price you can’t really complain. You have to remember that this is an entry level tablet so it isn’t going to have the look or feel of an iPad or Samsung tablet yet it holds its own for the category it is in. Give it a try,,,
1,,"Better, but not perfect UPSIDE: Faster than older model. Uploads from Amazon memory went pretty quickly.. Battery life is excellent in comparison to my last Kindle. Instead of needing recharging twice a day, it goes for a couple days. The extra operating RAM is also a plus in speed. Less time to open & shut down & programs operate promptly.DOWNSIDE: Many of my favorite apps will not work on this model. This is so frustrating when you can't play games or other apps you enjoy.",,,
2,"Nice Tablet For A Good Price I owned two earlier versions of the Kindle Fire.  This is clearly the best yet.  It is a little heavier than I expected, but the functionality is good and I like the battery life.",,,,

Other than that I like this very much.",,,,

9,,,,Less than 2 years later and amazon doesnt support their app on this device Amazon is losing sales for not supporting this device. Tells me amazon shopping app is no longer supported and I need to use a web browser. I refuse to use the web browser. This has caused my amazon purchases to drop drastically. No support for their own app after 2 years. What a joke. F U amazon. This will way heavily on my next tablet purchase. Extremely disappointed!!!!!!!!,
0,"double charging for Amazon books I liked it very much but I couldn't move my 39 books that I paid for that had placed on my cloud of my old kindle.

No. But you can add up to 1TB of memory (I added 400 gigs) vis Micro SD card, doubles just fine as an e-reader (one of the main reasons I bought it), and while the Amazon Store has many quality apps, the ability to side load the Google App Store makes this a quality tablet. Only quibble: the mini USB C port does not allow you to bypass the lesser quality internal DAC to stream music to a better DAC for better sound.",,,

No custom home, and download speeds are the worst I have ever seen.... I have 350 MB download and my Xbox downloads at 200mb up. My phone and laptop cap at 80mb but a bit farther from modem, this downloads very slow right next to it.I'm not sure what it is but I'm not impressed, hopefully after some time to get used to it...

With some earbuds, I watch my shows while in the same room as my partner, and we're both happy.  Perfect solution.",,,

2,"Quick and responsive Upgrade from an old model 8"" Fire tablet. Quite pleased with it overall, much faster than my older one. Sound quality could be better, but with headphones is great. Only real complaint I have is that it is very fussy about the micro sd cards you use for additional storage. So far battery life seems pretty fair.",,,,
3,,,"Good Amazon Marketing Strategy If you want a vehicle for Amazon to have wall-to-wall advertisements for their products and services, this is your iPad. The Amazon flood of advertisement apps are hardwired into the system. You cannot delete their apps. You will be constantly barraged with Amazon's ways to make more money off of you.",,
4,,"Wonderful My mom bought this because she needed something to get her school work done but is quite easy to carry around, and she absolutely loves it. The battery life is crazy good, she doesn't always have to be thinking and panicking if there's no outlet where she goes, it keeps 8hrs charge. The screen quality is pretty clean, with rapid response onthe toucescreen. I recommend.",,,
5,,,"Not the best changes There are many changes from the last  Generation and not all of them are good. The battery life is very low and it is very slow even though it has a larger processor. My SD card from my last kindle is not compatible with this one which means I have to transfer everything to my computer into my new kindle which is a step I wasn't anticipating to have to take. Overall I am not happy with the new generation and may go back to my old kindle even though the battery life for that 1 doesn't last very long either, but that is due to the age of it. My internet connection keeps dropping, especially in the middle of games, which is very annoying.",,
6,,"A nice upgrade! I had a 7th Gen 8"" Kindle Fire HD. The screen is better on this one, the processing seems faster with MUCH less lag (due to a faster processor and more RAM. The wireless charging seems to charge slow... but I'm NOT using Amazon's docking station, but my cell phone charging pad.

2,,,"Shuts down when in use My family and I have been proud Kindle owners in its many iterations for years and the Kindle Fire HD 8 is very good except for one thing! It shuts off all the time. It makes a distinct 'click' as it suddenly shuts off. We have two and they both do the same thing. I think it just has a very sensitive shut off mechanism on the sides or front for when you close a cover over it. This is ,unfortunately, a big flaw , as we need to constantly turn it back on while we are using it! Also, the on /off button is sluggish so sometimes it takes a while to turn it back on.: (",,

I was unable to address this issue (return within the required time frame) because my husband had surgery and I was assisting him with his recovery.

I like to use it for listening to audio books while I do other things, but is almost impossible to hear if my air conditioner or microwave is running.  I still need to get a case for it, but I dropped it yesterday and there was no damage and it still works just fine.

It's not that good.Screen is very touchy and starts to ghost react easily.Admittedly I came off an iPad mini that got destroyed, and thought this would be a good cheap alternative. It does a fair amount but overall the Amazon ecosystem is a pain, too limited and the devise is just so-so.I wouldn't bother getting it now I've tried it.",,

I am EXCITED to be Leaving again ....Got one for my niece too !I often search for things In PDF files or online and the speed is so much FASTER that I have not lost my train of thought before the search has found the reference.  The whole tablet experience is taken to a FUN NEW Level !,,,
3,,"upgraded and I love it! I had the old 8 that needed the special back adapter with the contact points to do wireless charging.  The new one has it built in and I LOVE not needing to chose between the charging back and the normal cover/case.  The new stand allows me to plop it on the charger with the case on, and then pull it off and go with out swapping cases.  Makes life so much easier.  It also seats better in the new stand when charging.",,,
4,,"No buyers remorse with this!! This is the perfect size for reading, or watching videos.  The wireless charging is a big plus.",,,
5,,"Thanks Amazon! Exceptional, a word I rarely use but this item has proven to be the Best Buy for me. First it sits in a charger therefore is visible at all times. I can ask Alexa for the weather, to list to music, turn volume up or down and all the time scrolling through my photos as background. A good size for reading. Also, I traded my 6-7 year old tablet so I received a great discount for all of this I say thanks Amazon!",,,
6,,Great item Works faster than older one,,,
7,"Good product, but has slight technical problem Overall product is great, but I have been experiencing the screen brightness to cycle, noticeably dimming at random times and then restoring brightness.  This is a little unsettling, though doesn't render unit unusable.",,,,
8,,,"Subpar screen resolution, awful software makes it almost unusable Not having an HD screen (as in 1900x1200, not the cheat resolutions) is not understandable nowadays. Even midrange phones had that for years now.The amazon software is a piece of nonsense that makes the tablet almost unusable. A useless store, apps on the quality of some cheap startup, and no configuration. Fortunately the google play store could be installed and the inbuilt apps disabled, including the software updates.Now it has a real web browser and it actually works pretty well for catching up on news and general web browsing.The tablet itself would get 4 stars (5-1 for the screen resolution). The software package would get negative stars if that were possible, so I settle for 1.Seriously, I thought only Apple would spend effort into needlessly screwing up decent hardware, but I stand corrected.",,
9,,Good quality Nice,,,
0,,Worked as Advertized Easy set up - no complaints.  Happy with purchase thus far.,,,
1,,Excellent quality I use my Kindle mostly for reading but also play a couple of games on it. I love my kindle,,,
2,,,,,"Doesn't support many important apps from older kindle versions This latest generation kindle does not support Adobe reader, among other apps I need to be able to print invoices, etc.  Instead it has its own reader for pdf files which is basically useless, because you cannot print from It, save bookmarks, change size of print, or style of print. It's worthless.Also this new kindle doesn't support mobi files which is the format for most kindle book files, especially Advanced Reader Copies of books from self publishing authors.  To say I am disappointed is putting it mildly. I was assured these problems will be fixed.  there are several scrabble type game apps that I have been playing in my other kindles for over five years that this version doesn't not support either. Apparently they were completely overlooked by the development team! So right now, this kindle is just a paper weight....."

These tablets are awesome for media content and just writing this review I see a speed improvement even over my newer HD10. What a breeze and a familiar and trusted device. Highly recommend! Just know you are not getting an IPad or Samsung device here. If you are in the Amazon eco system you will appreciate the upgrade. Stop reading the lackluster and unknowing reviews and reviewer complaints and buy now. You will not regret your decision. -Tony",,,
6,,,,,"Very Disappointed! First, let me say that I had an Amazon Fire tablet before this one that I loved but was destroyed in an accident.  Because I loved my first one, I purchased this one without hesitation.  This one seems to have a mind of its own.  The apps close by themselves and a previous app that I was using opens back up, or if there was no previous app it just shuts down.  I tried the help section and did all that it suggested and I even message with one of their support team and did everything he told me to, but it only lasted for about a day and then the apps automatically started closing again.  It happens both when I'm online and offline.  I had to take my dad for a doctor's appt. and brought this to play a game while waiting and in an hour's time the app closed 11 times.  Watching a movie or reading is not worth it.  I'll keep this to play games on and get another tablet for the more things."
7,"Ease of use. Mainly used for reading, some net surfing. The unit works well, the screen is smaller than I thought it would be. My older kindle was an HD 8.9 Fire. Screen was larger and easier to use.",,,,
8,,,"Not pleased I like that it’s a bit smaller than the previous Kindle I had, but overall I’m not pleased. Some of my music did not transfer over. The few games that I play transferred over, however, it was like starting from the beginning of the game. I was on the phone for an hour and a half with a support person trying to get my games up to date and to get my music to transfer to no avail. I found it more difficult to navigate than my old Kindle. Overall, I’m not as happy with this Kindle.",,
9,,,,,"Not suitable for elders or Latinos!! I bought this for my completely technology illiterate, 70 year old mother, expecting setup not to be very complicated and I could walk her though it in a video call. 4 Hours later we were still trying to set this up. First, initial setup cannot work without WiFi, which sucks and basically left her tabletless until I managed to find the WiFi password from her house. Secondly, you can only proceed with an Amazon account, which is to be expected, however you cannot download any apps, even free ones like YouTube without entering credit card information, which honestly seems very sketchy and greedy. The third and absolute worst reason which caused me to return this, is that after 4 hours of setup I manage to get her to turn on Alexa (which is the second reason why I went for this tablet in the first place), only to realize Alexa doesn't support Spanish for my Latina mother. Really?? 2020 and an AI assistant doesn't understand Spanish??? This was completely unbelievable since we use echo dots in Spanish just fine, but apparently the tablet version only supports English, German, Japanese, and I believe Italian. Unbelievable!!!So heads up all Latino and Spanish customers, as of now Alexa won't work in Spanish at all!!"
0,,"This tablet exceeds my expectations! I am grateful for the excellent battery life of this tablet because i find myself talking it everywhere with me.

It has what's called ""LOCATION SERVICES"" listed in the ""SETTINGS"" but it sits and tries to turn this on.  The only way you can get it to identify where you are is to over ride it and type it in....NO matter where you are.  I contacted AMAZON's TECH service.  The two techs that I talked to accessed the unit only to determine They were just as surprised as I was.  My frustration rose when I spent over an  hour on the phone to get the last tech to troubleshoot everything he knew to do.Of course I had the replacement longer...but this one would freeze - activate apps without touching screen.; as if that wasn't enough....it would automatically add ""SUGGESTED"" apps everyday to the ""HOME SCREEN""...after I spent the extra money for a ""NON AD"" version of this tablet.ONE The UPSIDE- Battery life was great along  with the sound coming from the dual speakers."

They told me to go into Settings and to turn-off Recommendations.  I did this, but the system is clearly still running Ads in the background and now the start-up screen is very slow and sluggish as all we've done is trick the home screen from actually showing those ads.  A true ""no add"" model should have those features totally disabled *prior to shipping to the customer and it should not in any way affect or slow the operating capability of the tablet itself.  Not satisfactory for the price paid.",,

The tablet is very easy to work, the screen quality is great and touch screen very easy to work. The battery life is amazing. My very first Fire Tablet and I love it!",,,
8,,"Simple... While I normally used higher powered Android, or Windows tablets for work this one does the trick with simplicity.  I have several Kids Fire Tablet for the grandkids when they visit.  I added this one for one of the older kids, for some sophistication...  It has not left my office because it is extremely portable and functional.",,,

1,"Fire I had a original fire. So the new one is different, just trying learn how to navigate through it and finding what I want isn’t as easy as I thought it would be.",,,,
2,Great reader but too small. Beautiful reader but too small to view or read the many magazines I subscribe to. Even zooming in I have to constantly move the paragraphs back and forth to read them.,,,,
3,,Good for the price Got it for my kids. They can play every game with no lagging.  Plays all there videos no problems,,,
4,,Love the Fire HD 8 The new Kindle Fire HD 8 has the longest battery life of all my previous Kindles.  I’m able to travel with it for days without recharging.  I’m loving it.  Thank you.,,,

6,,So far so good The size is perfect and the performance is fast but then again it’s brand new so hopefully it continues. The only thing is I wish it was anti glare screen but it’s doing what it’s suppose to do 😊 love that the memory is expandable with a memory card and also i can download basically any app,,,
7,All around okay tablet They need to add more to the app store and make it a lot bigger All around nice tablet nice tablet Battery is okay in the screen quality is nice I need to work on the auto correct feature though,,,,
8,Good value- Needs full Android I have had several fire tablets. I use them for myself and have given several to grandkids.This version may be a little more nimble and is a good value.If I were to suggest something it would be to load Fire tablets with full Android instead of the restricted one it is infamous for,,,,
9,,,"Some things aren't quite right This review is a work in progress.  The physical size of the Plus is different that the previous version I have, Gen 7. I did not know that the older HD8 size changed last year so my old cover would not fit.  There goes another $30 for a $1.46 cost to make item.  And you have to have it, unfortunately.  Screen ""feel"" is sticky, my fingers do not slide across, they catch and drag.  I peeled off my previous stick on screen, cut it down, and it works, but isn't pretty.  The Fire is about 1/2"" wider and now I can't securely grasp it with one hand.  I suppose these are minor considering it's a $130 Amazon order device, but I don't like these ""features"".",,

9,Faster to load—Yeah! Thank goodness they upped the speed of this tablet.  I had the 2019 version and it took forever to load Amazon.  I’m not a fan of the “Home” and “For You” menu bar.  Too many clicks to get anywhere.,,,,
0,Love kindle. I take it with me wherever I go. Used to my old kindle fire- it’s more user friendly. Still trying to figure out some things. I use it primarily as reader. Not as intuitive as my old fire. I’m sure it will grow on me.,,,,
1,,,"so disappointed about FAT32 for SD card I was really disappointed to find out that the format for the SD card in the new Kindle Fire 8 has to be FAT32.  Which means, files have a maximum size of 4GB.  Which in turn means that movie files can be hard to put on an SD card due to their often being larger than the max FAT32 file size.  Almost every other device I have bought in the past few years supports formats like exFAT... and other Kindles also used to support exFAT.  It's a big limitation, one I didn't even think about having to live with given that this used to be a non-issue.  Really limits the usefulness for me, hope a firmware update in the future can remove this limitation.",,
2,,I use this tablet as my kindle. I use it for reading & checking my email.,,,
3,"10th Gen is great, but give me my Categories back!!! I LOVE the latest generation of the Fire Tablet (10th Gen), however they recently did an update of it and they took away the categories going across that says Home, Books, newstand, Audible, etc... they replaced it with just 3 headings. For You, Home and Library...... I HATE IT!!! Please give me back my categories....",,,,
4,,"Battery Last I had a 7th generation Fire and the battery would deplete quickly and it was annoying.  This battery last so much longer, and the device is so much faster.  Format is alittle different, and I don't know if I care for it, but everything is there.  Great little device.",,,

1,,Great Kindle Kindle came packaged securely.A breeze to set up with excellent help..works Great...,,,
2,,,,Terrible product. This is the worst piece of electronics I have ever purchased in my life. I loved the original kindle fire. In fact my original kindle fire still works but has a bit of a charging problem from being so old. And that caused me to purchase the newest kindle fire. But everything about this tablet is awful. The touch screen is unresponsive. The physical button placement causes you to turn off the tablet every time you try to pick it up. Certain very popular apps do not work on this tablet including YouTube.  It is built like a child's toy.. I would recommend thatno one ever buys this product. Sorry Jeff but this was a swing and a miss.,
3,,,"Came with ads despite paying extra to have them removed I've owned a Fire tablet previously and wanted something with more memory and speed.  I was excited to ""upgrade"" and willing to pay extra to have ads removed.  I've been disappointed to find that ads still show on my games.  I'm not sure what I paid extra for!Also, the illumination of the screen dims while I'm reading or playing games.  This didn't happen with my old one, and I don't know how to correct that or if it is a design flaw.It is faster, and that makes my gaming more enjoyable.",,
4,,Got this for my granddaughters for Christmas and they love them. My granddaughters love to watch movies on these when we travel. Good battery life and storage capacity,,,
5,,,,,"Disappointed I though this would be great.  It is not.  I should have saved up & gotten the iPad.  The Amazon app refuses to allow me to sign in; keeps saying I need to check my internet connection (even when other apps have no problem). It is not as easy to navigate or find the settings needed as an iPhone - when the settings even exist.  iPhone battery lasts longer too.  Half the time the touch screen doesn’t do anything - especially if it’s been asleep, so it takes forever to get to the home screen.  Alexa is not nearly as helpful as I’d hoped.  The alarm I’d set went off and the touch screen wouldn’t let me in to shut it off, so I finally asked Alexa to turn it off and she replied “There is no alarm set” AYFKM??? This is not how I need to be at 6am.  She does appear to understand how to play music.  So I have a great $125 radio.  And why the heck do I have a subscription to the Washington Post of all things?"
6,,Easy to use with great battery life Easy to use convenient and great battery life,,,
7,"Battery life For a $90 tablet it is very good. A big update over the last gen. Something to point out about battery life that the 8+es battery is that it doesn't actually charge faster then the 8, it just comes with a 9 watt charger, vs. a 5 watt on the 8.",,,,
8,"Smaller unit size than prior Fires Did not like being notified this unit is smaller than the prior models of Fires, as such you need to purchase another model case. The screen size is the same.Otherwise its a great unit.",,,,
9,,,Good Screen The power and volume buttons are too close. When trying to increase or decrease volume I usually hit the power button turning it off-It is annoying after a while. The speakers are also only in one side-when holding it straight most of the time I block the bottom speaker. It would be nice if they were on the top both sides.,,
0,"It has it’s place for the price Its slow, noticeable latency when selecting apps, etc. You can use it for an Echo Show, but speaker is tinny.  Keep in mind though that it’s not a several hundred dollar ipad.  For the price you get a color kindle and a decent Echo portable Show",,,,
1,as advertised as advertised,,,,
2,,,Not Satisfied... It isn't connected to the google play store and that is where most of my games are located. Also I don't like it being connnected to my Amazon account.,,
3,,Great battery life and video quality! So fun for game apps and movies on the go! I don’t have to use the battery on my phone and I can download anything to watch and play anywhere. I bought 5 for me and my family we all love them so much and feel great to all be a part of the Kindle Fire Club!,,,
4,"Great Function - But Weighty This is my 4th Kindle Fire, so I am a fan.  It has all the great features as my previous Fires, ease of use, great screen resolution and easy to use. The only thing that I would change is the weight. It is noticeably heavier than my previous small fire.",,,,
5,Does what it's intended for.. I didnt like how it took a while to find certain things I needed to download ..they weren't available on the app store so I had to download google apps...I like the vibrant color /picture though,,,,

9,,,,"Product developed issues 16 days after warranty expired - nothing to be done except by a new one. I thought this would be a reasonably priced replacement for another maker's tablet I owned that became obsolete after 8 years of use.  It gets the job done, however, when I went to charge it recently there were issues. Very likely they were there during the 90 day warranty period but I didn't notice because I didn't need to recharge. I consulted with Amazon tech support who informed me that the warranty on the tablet had expired 16 days previously and that my only option is to replace the product at my own cost. I complained about this and they then offered a 15% discount on my replacement. This is pathetic customer service, especially considering that this tablet basically exists to sell amazon content and products to its users.  Gonna start saving my money for a real tablet. No more Amazon hardware for me.",
0,,"Nice Budget Tablet A great versatile tablet that just works well out of the box. Relatively lightweight, quick start up and bright enough for it's low price. Screen resolution is fine for casual e-book reading and streaming. The wireless charging feature is a plus. It works well with my Anker wireless USB charger.",,,
1,,,,,"Setup frustrating / quirky unit I was impressed with the fact that I ordered the tablet this morning and received it 3:20pm same day.However the frustration mounted in setup, when I could see all the neighbor's wi-fi's but not my own! Luckily I've been doing IT stuff for over 30 years. I cancelled setup and got into the main screen then entered setting/preferences. Sure enough my suspicions were confirmed when I saw airplane mode button ON !!!!! ON A NEW OUT OF THE BOX TABLET! It's supposed to be easy for novices etc. but this was not. I'd suggest fixing the issue.But after using it for a month other frustrations emerge. Plug it in to recharge: nothing -- needs a restart.Wifi lost for no obvious reason: needs a restart. Video becomes choppy: needs a restart. If this is just MY tablet, OK. But if others have the same issues, it's trouble."
2,,It's great!!! This is a great tablet especially for the price I did trade in an older tablet and I got this on sale so it was incredibly inexpensive.  The tablet is great for media and for surfing the internet.  I also use it to pay bills and listen to music and books and read books.  It is very versatile and useful.  On a full charge it works great too...lasts for a while.,,,
3,,"Great for listening to music. I bought this for my wife, who has dementia, to listen to.  It helps her to relax, keeps her occupied in a positive frame of mind, and allows her to do other things with her hands.  Great battery life.

4,Get it without ads. I hate the way it keeps cutting off and going to a new advertisement.,,,,

6,,My HD fire 8 Perfect size!,,,
7,,,,"Very Little Improvement over 5th Gen HD-8 Amazon Kindle performance has deteriorated over the years. I have a 5th Generation HD-8 that worked great until the latest update. The update slowed it down tremendously, so I purchased an new 10th Gen Kindle hoping for much improved performance. The 10th Gen Kindle HD-8 is slow to load books, and is difficult to navigate around to find features that were easy to get to under the old system.  More importantly the Whisper sync feature seldom  works between my HD-8 , iPad and iPhone. Whisper sync between the iPad and iPhone is flawless, but is very spotty between the Apple devices and the HD-8. My husband is now experiencing the same thing with his iPad and 7th Gen HD-8 syncing. He has a Android phone and it syncs with the HD-8 very well, but not the iPad.  Yes, we checked to ensure Whisper sync is turned-on on all devices. I am very disappointed with the most recent Kindle update. In fact my whole family is complaining about their kindle performance since the installing the new update. We have 4 Kindles of different generations, and all of them are experiencing poor performance since the new system upgrade.  Amazon needs to come out with a fix to their operating system soon if they expect to remain competitive.  I would not recommend buying a Kindle device until Amazon fixes their operating system.  The new system is too slow and unreliable, as well as unstable.",
8,,"GREAT for reading! I bought my first Kindle 7 years ago, and it was wonderful.  Then my app software for my local library was no longer supported, so I decided to upgrade to the 8 Plus.  It is wonderful, but I'm still learning to use it, not being that familiar with it yet.  I have figured out how to download books, so I'm very happy with that.  I highly recommend it!",,,
9,,"LOVE IT! Love my new Kindle HD 8 Plus. Love the 64 GB. I actually already had an 8"" Kindle, but wanted to upgrade the memory and wanted the wireless charging capability. LOVE IT!!!

Now days I'm retired and I can do everything I need to on my Kindle. So easy to use!",,,
0,,Totally worth it! I love kindle. I absolutely love my voyage and think they should bring them back. I upgraded my fire 8 hd from 2017 to the new 8 plus and love the new features. It’s easy to set up and customize settings. Love the ability to have a black screen with white text. Not sure I’d use the sepia or green back screens but they are an option if I ever need them. Charges super fast and am looking forward to being able to use wireless charging.,,,
1,,"It's more than a kindle This was an upgrade from my older kindle.  Speed and memory are greatly improved however, the show feature may be my favorite feature.  I purchased this with the wireless dock and can honestly say it has increased my love for the product.  It provides wireless charging and becomes a show while docked.  In essence you have a show, wireless charging, and the portability of the kindle.  I'm very happy.",,,
2,,Decent Tablet This was given as a gift and I have heard no complaints.,,,
3,,Worth every penny I love this tablet!  It is light weight so easy to handle. Fits in my bag perfect. I can read and play games for hours and the battery is still good. I love the charging station also. All I have to do it prop it up and go on my way. Would recommend both,,,
4,,,,"If you are looking for SD card storage look else where. I purchased both the 10 and 8 inch models. The 8 inch to carry backpacking and when I did not want to be bothered with the larger model. The 10 inch was purchased so that I could easily read my magazine subscriptions and be able to do some basic work. The primary reason I purchased both tablets was that they support a micro SD card of up to 1 terabyte. With that much storage I could carry around all of my Kindle library, photos, Amazon music, and a good portion of my video library. I was profoundly disappointed and angry that not a single Amazon application will store to the external storage card. In fact the deception extends far beyond the Amazon applications. The only application that I have found that will store content to the external SD card is Netflix.As far as I am concerned, the fact that you cannot store Amazon app content on the SD card constitutes deceptive advertising. Also, the advertising touted the speed of the devices, which is much better than the earlier ones. However they are both still slower than my 2015 Samsung Tab S4. If I had not spent an additional $350 dollars on two terabyte micro SD cards plus the cost of covers and fast chargers I would return them immediately.",

I also was not able to access any of my previously downloaded Kindle books, but that could be user error.  I did try the Google Play workaround, but that also did not work.This was not what I was looking for, but again, if I was, this is an excellent little device.  It was very sturdy and the camera was awesome.",,
8,"Unwanted Alexa responses feedback. On this HD 8 plus 10th gen tablet there is only two choices for the ""wake word"" Alexa, or Amazon. So all your alexa devices will be listening and you will get unwanted responses. Hopefully Amazon will address this issue in an update!",,,,

When I set up my new Fire, I had not backed up my old bookmarks, etc. I thus had to do the backup, reset the new one to factory settings, then go through set-up again. It then gave me the option of importing all my old data, saving me a lot of time.The charging stand (sold separately) is a great addition. Highly recommended.",,,

Tons of value for the money.",,,
4,Screen Needs improvement in the battery life . Screen can be in my opinion Oled screen ..,,,,

I can't speak to the battery life since I'm not the one using it.",,,
6,Ad Free? I guess I do not understand what 'ad free' meant as there seems to be about the same amount of ads on it as my old kindle.,,,,
7,,,,"You are buying non-stop advertising even if you pay extra to not have ads Purchased this on Prime Day, paid the extra money to not have ads. I decided on this device over other tablets because it could be used as an Echo Show when placed in the wireless dock. Unfortunately, in Echo Show mode, this thing just spits out a non-stop endless drivel of Amazon advertising, instead of the nice stream of my own pictures that I selected. It either superimposes the ads over my pics, or uses idiotic advertising pics from Amazon. Note that I paid extra for no ads. To put a finer point on this, the messages and pics are not always ads, but sometimes just nonsensical suggestions or news that Amazon feels the need to run. In either case, it renders the device unusable for its intended purpose: I want to use it as an Echo show with my pics on it, not a nonstop advertising deviceI have an Echo Show 8, which allows most of this intrusive nonsense to be turned off, but no such setting exists in this device. Those who have been following this advertising/content problem that Amazon has will recall that the Echo Show had this same problem initially, but after a lot of people returned the devices, they made a provision to turn the ads off. Well, not completely off, but get them down to a point where the returns stopped.This could have been a 4-5 star review because the tablet works fairly well otherwise, though I have not taken the time to really learn how to use it since it is being returned. I am very disappointed.",

My case no longer fits either so I will need to get a new one. The touch screen does not operate as smoothly as my previous unit either. I need to slide my finger several times to get it to do what I want. Also, it locks up at times when Alexa is on and I find it difficult to get back to the normal menu screen.

5,,,,,"No Good For Audible books I'm not a gamer, and don't need my email or any of the extras on my Kindle, they're already on my phone.  First tablet - Super easy set up.  All my Audible books were there.  I was a happy camper.  Worked for a couple of days then started cutting out/skipping.  Total surprise!! I sent it back.Second one - If I can get Audible to load at all, the books are there.  However, they have a hard time getting going - skipping, stuttering, and then stopping altogether before the screen changes back to Home.  Eight times out of ten I give up and listen on my iPhone.  Since my brain has reached the stage where reading is  difficult I depend on my Audible books completely.  I removed all my Kindle books, email,  and every app I could (though most were not removable), thinking I may have overloaded the tablet's capability.  No difference.  I can still use it for Solitaire and maybe Bejeweled hand/eye coordination practice. Wish I could remove all the apps I don't need and load some that would be helpful for my failing brain."
6,,"Perfect for replacing my old Kindle After I dropped my 2015 7"" Kindle and cracked the screen, when the repairman said it would cost $60 to repair it I figured it was time for a newer version.

 The tablet is pretty good, my daughter says it glitches sometimes but most of the time it's good, she's able to download lots of apps and play for a long time without the tablet getting too hot.",,,
9,,"as I imagined it I have been using it for a month and it works very well, I recommend it. +++++",,,
0,,"Extra ram vs other models Has more RAM than the others which means it will be useful longer. I do suggest grabbing it on sale. I bought two of these and a month later it would have cost me $80 less. I got good cases for them and warranties and ended up paying just slightly more than the kids 8"" version. Worth it.",,,
1,glass protector problem I found the enclosed screen protector hard to instal and full of bubbles even though I tried to follow directions. The tablet itself is great.,,,,
2,"Good budget tablet Good budget tablet, however still a little sluggish when compared to a 2 Year old Samsung tab A.",,,,
3,Good tablet for the price with limitations It's a good tablet for the price. But it's disappointing that Google Play and Chrome is not available on this tablet without jumping through a bunch of hoops. The Libby app for reading ebooks checked out of libraries is also not available.,,,,
4,,,,"Doesn't accept app downloads, everything is proprietary This tablet is awful. I bought it to download song apps to(I'm a singer and need to break down songs) not a single app I tried to download,would. And when I did get one to.do2nload ,it didn't work. It's siting in an end table where it probably will stay till I give it to a little kid to watch Bluey or some other weird cartoon. I'll never buy another fire tablet. Should have went with a regular android",
5,,,,,"How disappointing I've always been a big fan of Amazons Kindle Fires. I've been buying then for years and have always been relatively happy with then The exception being the 6"" HD because of the size nothing else. Well it was time to replace my Fire 7 HD and my Fire 8 HD both from 2016. I ordered the Fire HD 8+ it had features I liked (Wireless charging, more RAM, New C type USB Etc.) The problem with this device is the NEW placement of the power button. They moved it from the corner to the middle so when I'm playing games (most are played in landscape) I am constantly putting my tablet to sleep! This it quite annoying. I can't even turn it over and use it upside down, as all that does it place it under my other hand, and you got it same problem. That is my main problem with it but then playing games is the main reason I got it. There is also an app I use that no longer works on it. I may end up sending it back and  going to an Android tablet, I'll just have to eat the cover I bought."
6,,,"Not all I expected I did some research before ordering this, and found that I could watch my verizon fios tv shows on this. I'm very disappointed that this appears to be false.",,
7,,It is in fact an e-reader It's good so far. I like it.,,,
8,,Gift It was my daughter's Christmas gift and she haven't put it down. Great for her age and her hands.,,,
9,NICE TABLET good tablet,,,,
0,,,"Battery life is tooooooo short. When I watch tv shows, it allows me just over 3.5 hours.Besides that, it works fine.",,
1,,"I love to be able to be on Facebook, play games & pictures I had the first old kindle & this new HD Fire is AWESOME",,,
2,,Works great I like all. Use for : love word puzzles. Watch on youtube series or info. Love it,,,
3,,Good product.iPad quality. Get an iPad. Can some1 help me out with memory card problem? It’s a little laggy. But for the price it works pretty fantastic. I’m a google user so I downloaded the google play store to keep everything consistent. If anyone could help me with this though. I got a Samsung memory card to add my storage space and when in my tablet.. my tablet runs way slower... anyone know how to fix it?,,,
4,"I want better Bought to replace my Fire HDX. It is faster than my HDX, and the battery lasts MUCH longer, but the screen quality it not near as good as the HDX. Amazon, why don't you make a high-end Fire tablet any more?",,,,
5,User dominant The spellchecker is not helpful. The touchscreen behavior is unpredictable and does respond by changing the words to something else I keyed in.The tablet used for checking emails or quick searches.,,,,
6,It’s smaller than I wanted. It’s fine for what little I use it.  It’s the perfect size to throw in my purse.,,,,
7,,"Size is not everything This is slightly smaller than my Kindle Fire which was basicallly only a reader.  However, this tablet comes with Alexa which is a plus for me.  The size does not really  matter because I can reset the font in the Kindle to however big I want.  I am happy with this tablet - good choice for me.",,,
8,,"Much better than my old Fire This is really a great device.  It has all the speed and capability of the 10, but a lot cheaper.  It just has a smaller screen, but for what i use it for, it is excellent.  I mainly read books, do some minor web browsing and minimal email, but it all works great.",,,
9,,works well good design big improvement from past models,,,
0,,"Fast processor and lots of memory I really like the HD 8 Plus. The memory is fantastic and the processing is fast! The screen is definitely HD, crisp, clear and sharp images. Extra long battery, in 30 days, I have only charged up twice!I also love the screen size. It is just right, for my small hands.",,,
1,Different shape Liked that it is HD.  Not liking the fatter shape.  Doesnt fit hand as nicely,,,,
2,,,,,Its hard to hold and clunky. This fire is clunky and wide. It makes it very difficult to hold.I am thinking about returning it because of this issue.
3,,,"Back cheap plastic Very cheap easy to scuff scratch China recycled plastic llc and why would i pay 35.99 for a case thats close to the price I paid for the tablet, I should had bought a android lesson learned.. wow",,
4,,was happy with my purchase of the Fire HD 8 much better than the previous model,,,
5,Good Mid size Kindle I like the size and it has good battery life. The touch screen could be an easier “touch” in my opinion.  The color is good and the overall display is easy to adjust and read.,,,,
6,,"Great tablet Bought for my brother, he was very happy and impressed 👍",,,
7,,Kindle Fire The quickness of maneuvering on the kindle 8 is awsome!,,,
8,,"Mobile Entertainment Center I love this little thing. I use it as a mobile entertainment center and portable textbook when I'm on the go. At home I use it as an echo show. Its not a Galaxy Tab and it's not lightning fast, but it has good enough speed for movies and videos, streamed or downloaded, as well as searching massive textbooks with tens of thousands of pages within reasonable times. Can't beat the price!",,,
9,,"Nice budget tablet, don't do the buy back I have the previous model too. This one is much more responsive.  I got it on sale so I am very happy with it. I really like the wireless charging.I feel the buy back program is a complete rip off. I am keeping my older tablet and using it as an Amazon Show. Amazon, you can do better.",,,
0,"New Plus Version Is a Big Improvement! I REALY LIKE this new version. The screen quality is great, but a nonglare screen cover would be greater yet! I like the new placement of the power button. Also, charges quickly.",,,,
1,,,Battery still runs down quick Seems to need charging daily.  Battery runs down.,,
2,"Proprietary Charging Cable Fast shipping, received in a day and a half. Enjoying it so far, easy set up and transfer from my other fire 8. But, SERIOUSLY, the charger is now proprietary? Only the charging cable with the tablet charges the tablet. Thanks Amazon!",,,,
3,,"3GB RAM Does it For Me! 3gb RAM is at the top of my reasons for loving this tablet. The overall dimensions are smaller than the 8th Gen model, making the latest model, still at 8 inches, easier to manage. So, faster response time and improved manageability make this tablet a pleasure to consume all the Prime fare if you are a die-hard Amazonian, as I am. This tablet needs to expand beyond gray slate in color availability. All in all, love this tablet.",,,
4,"Sounds as if I'm not satisfied, but thats not true. Happy with the resolution.  Starts up fast.  Perhaps a little heavy for hours-long reading.  With a case, it would be uncomfortably heavy.  Page-turning controls are super sensitive!  The design of the opening page makes me wish I had gone for no ads.",,,,
5,,Great gift for the price It was a gift and the recipient has enjoyed it from what I have been told,,,
6,,kindle fire8 i love my new kindle.  im having trouble with some of the programs but i will figure them out  so glad i got the new kindle.  i have owned one for years and i always loved it and used it all the time.  now this one is bigger and better.  i need to get a cover for it to protect it,,,
7,,,,"Goes Completely Dead At Will This is my fifth Kindle. All of my old ones still work, but I like to keep up with technology, so last September I ordered this one, a Kindle case and a wireless charger for the Kindle case. I wish I hadn't.From the second day, I've had problems with this Kindle. It goes dead whenever it wants. What I mean by that is that it's full or partially charged but will not turn on. It will not turn on with the button, it will not turn on if I hold the button down. The only way to get it back on is to plug it in or put it on the wireless charger. Since I don't carry the cord or the wireless charger with me, this is not acceptable.I reached out for help on the Amazon Fire HD 8 forum and they told me to perform some procedure, which I did. It was fine for a few weeks but then it started happening again. Now it's about every other day. I called cust service and they want to give me 15% off a new Kindle. Why would I buy another one after this? This one is only 9 months old.If Amazon won't stand behind it, why would I buy another one? My next tablet will be an iPad.",
8,,"Excellent Product for Excellent Price It’s great for Microsoft school work and watching videos while traveling. As a student, it is an excellent price and very reasonable for average consumers.",,,
9,,"Very pleased with the speed and response of the screen. Have had no issues, use as a kids tablet. Very quick. Plenty of storage to download shows for my kids for car rides",,,
0,,,"Ok for the price, but pretty low quality as a result Ok for the price, but pretty low quality as a result",,
1,,,,,"Not great for gaming, no Google play, only Amazon and you have to sign in. I bought this with the intention of playing games, making zoom calls, and watching media. I didn't realize it was pretty much only for Amazon stuff, and you can't even download Google play.The power button is close to the volume buttons so I kept putting it to sleep. Audio is pretty good for the price and size, but you can't really use it for gaming."
2,,,"Push notifications don't work No push notifications for apps. It's slightly sluggish, but it's a cheap tablet",,
3,Nice speed poor speaker placement. The speaker placement of this hd8 plus being on the top is terrible. The hd8 5th gen had the speakers on the bottom and therefore the sound was aimed at me. The new speakers are aimed away from viewer and therefore has a lower sound quality. ☹️,,,,
4,,"Works well The screen quality, battery life and touch screen work very well and I would recommend this tablet to anyone",,,
5,,Good quality User friendly,,,
6,"Very nice tablet and a great buy! Awesome tablet, screen quality is great, good speed and battery life",,,,
7,On off button The only thing I have found so far that I do not like is where the on/off button is. I turn it off freq trying to watch a movie. Just not a good place for that button. Should be on top.,,,,
8,,Great product. I liked the picture qualityTouchscreen and ability to add memory and get appsJust still small image,,,
9,very good product. It is a bit heavy but I am happy with my new kindel. Just wish there was an easy way to transfer info from old kindle to new one.,,,,
0,,"Great Value The Fire HD 8 Plus tablet is a noticeable performance improvement over the previous generation.  Battery life is excellent and the size is perfect for my needs.  I find it the ""go to"" tablet for quick Internet access and leave it laying around everywhere so I can grab it when needed.  At regular pricing it is a good value but if you can catch it on sale I am amazed at the performance for such a low cost tablet.",,,
1,,"Very easy to use, and the size is perfect! Very easy to use and carry. Nice size.",,,
2,touch screen i love this only one problem i have found is the touch screen does not always work find myself touch it a few times before it works,,,,
3,,Good I like the Fire HD 8 plus tablet its easy to use. I would have liked the volume to be louder though. But I'm able to connect to speakers. I'm not sure why the charger gets hot when I charge it. Ill keep an eye on that.,,,
4,,Does what I need it to do.  Great litle tablet. Easy to use,,,
5,,Quality Fire Bought for wife I have an older fire both units working fine,,,
6,,,,,"Not worth it if you want to use Kindle app! I bought (Nov 2020) the Kindle Fire 8"" tablet wanting something bigger to read my kindle books on instead of using my phone.  I have had nothing but problems with the kindle app.  Haven't had any problems with other apps like You Tube or Amazon Video jut Kindle app.I tried to download my kindle library and about 1/3 of the books won't download all I get is the damn ! on the book thumbnail.  I even changed the default device from my phone to the Fire tablet without success.  I also am subscribed to Kindle Unlimited and have the same luck...only about 1/2 the books will download.It's too late to return the damn thing so another expensive paperweight.  Oh I could exchange it cause the warranty.  No thanks as I will most likely have the same problem!  Should of saved my $$ and bought a Samsung tablet."
7,,Tablet fire hd Excelente tableta,,,
8,,"Best Kindle Yet This is our third Kindle.  The first one is still going strong, although the screen is smaller.  The second one (Kindle 7) no longer holds a charge and can only be used while plugged in.  The 8 Plus is just a great little tablet with the larger screen, clear display and great functionalilty.",,,
9,,"Really like this device! I use it for reading mostly but I replaced an old 7, maybe the 1’st ever 7 fire. So this new 8 is like my iPad except smaller and lighter, which is good because I have arthritis in my hands so this is A nice little device for me.",,,
0,,Battery life is good. Battery life is good,,,
1,,Great gift for my Daughter My daughter absolutely loves her tablet.  She can't put it down.,,,
2,,So easy to use!! The battery life is great! I can play several movies or TV shows and it's still at 80% battery.,,,
3,,,"Terrible app selection I bought this tablet to help me use my phone less, since it's old and too expensive to replace. Joke's on me. I can only download a couple of the games I regularly play on my phone from the Amazon App Store. This was pretty much a waste of money... the tablet itself is really nice, but it's basically a paperweight unless you can afford to buy books constantly.",,
4,,"Great Product and Portable It was purchased for toddler, but he will need to use two fingers as opposed to one.",,,
5,,"Its so easy to use and so easy on the eyes I was upset that the Kindle I had for about a year stopped working and I called hoping I would get a credit but that did not happen  Also,  you mailed me a charger device that Idid not ask for and charged me $45.00  I am waiting for a credit to show up on my account.  I sent the charging device back",,,
6,,,"Does not perform as well as previous fire tablets This is the third ""Kindle"" fire tablet I have owned.  The others worked well and were very durable for quite some time.  I have only had this Fire tablet about a week and so far it is not nearly as good as the previous two I owned.  It was difficult to get charged and operational.  I had to download the Kindle app which now runs continuously or so the tablet says.  It sends me messages that the Kindle app does not shut off.  The tablet has frozen while I am using it which means I have to reboot, losing whatever I am working on.  Not nearly as high quality as my two previous tablets.",,
7,,,Great for kids and shopping on Amazon that's about it! I know Amazon was trying to hit the budget market with the Fire lineup and they did a great job with that it feels cheap to the touch under performs and is really only good for shopping on Amazon branded sites. The most disappointing thing though is unless you pay extra be ready for lots of adds! If you are ordering this tablet for young kids that may break it its a good investment as it doesn't cost much but if you want a truly functional tablet save up a little longer and get something worth the cost in this case you really do get what you pay for!,,
8,,Great tablet Great tablet,,,
9,,"I love it! So many upgraded features!  Just the right size, too for carrying with you.  Couldn't ask for more for the price!",,,
0,,Amazing Um my battery lasts way more than 12 hours and the standby mode is excellent,,,
1,,"Great for the price. Great tablet for the price.  If you’re looking for 1080+, multitasking, etc, look elsewhere. But, if you want a tablet for casual YouTube, Netflix and browsing, this is perfect. The only real downside is that it’s not 1080p, but I got over that quickly.  The best part is that it still has a headphone jack, haha. The wireless charging is nice as well.  For what use it for, it’s great!",,,
2,,,"Good product generally... For what I bought this unit for it is just fine but I have one complaint that if fixed could put the above to all fives.  There is currently not a method to disable the ""Device Dashboard"" button in lower left of screen.  I am always accidentally touching it because of its location and it interrupts whatever I am doing, reading, viewing a video, whatever.  Nuisance.  This is my fourth and last Kindle Fire if they can't provide a way of disabling that POS button!  I can't say enough about what a nuisance that 'feature' is....",,
3,,,"Will replace the HDX It compares to my HDX which had a cracked screen and a battery that would no longer charge. I would like for Amazon to find a way to transfer everything including progress on any games/apps.  If I sign in to the  Kindle with my Amazon account, then Amazon should keep the progress in storage in the cloud. My previous Kindle would do a backup to the cloud, but evidently this does not include progress on games/apps. The same games/apps that have to be purchased through Amazon. It does a good job with transferring the books.",,
4,Great traveling tablet Product is great for the money. It’s a great tablet for streaming video apps and as an e reader. Unfortunately it does not cast or allow you to use a USB to HDMI to hook up to a TV.,,,,
5,"Mostly very good.  Been waiting on something that rivaled the former HDX model. I like Alexa access.  Functions, speed and storage all good.  Lack of screen mirroring was the only disappointment.",,,,
6,Needs a User’s Guide This desperately needs a user’s guide. I bought this for someone who is fairly tech illiterate and he can’t figure anything out by himself. Not the best way to learn and be able to use all this tablet’s capabilities.,,,,
7,,"Fire 8+ Not much difference from the Fire 8, however, really love the charging stand. I read so much, the battery was always running low, but now with the Fire 8+ and charging stand, it's always charged.  It seems a little faster than old Fire 8 as well.",,,
8,"An improvement! But still flawed The new kindle is definitely faster at everything than the previous model. The screen quality has not really changed. The biggest and best improvement is the battery, this device literally lasts all day. Also the wireless recharge is such a good feature.",,,,

0,,"for mobile gaming i love it , i play call of duty mobile on it , i never lag in the game and i also play other mobiles game and never lag  either, it runs smooth with high graphics and high pfs on it , love the battery life will last me all day just playing mobiles games on it , would be nice to have higher ram on it,",,,

1,,,,,"Why am I still getting ads when I paid extra for the ""without ads"" version of this? It's functional and as advertised, other than the fact that ""without ads"" is a complete lie.Pretty much every time I open my kindle I have to dismiss ads for Amazon apps that I have absolutely no interest in (they label them ""new items"" as if that's supposed to fool us or something). I'm 31 years old with no children, no, I do not want the damn Sesame Street app; stop asking.I won't be buying another Kindle when this one needs replacing. I can get an android tablet with access to the Google Play store and all of the apps that come with it, instead of using a bootleg YouTube app or Kindle's awful Silk browser"
2,,,Battery life is good I really haven't decided yet.  I needed more storage and more battery life and this seemed like a good option.  I have really used any of the other features and haven't figured out if Alexa is something I want.,,
3,I prefer the Fire over the kindle ereaders I prefer the amazon Fire HD tablets without the ads. It runs fairly smooth without them. But the main reason I got this is because I like my kindle app better on the Fire over the kindle ereaders,,,,
4,,"I'm Loving it Great improvement in technology over my other tablet which I bought back in 2016, that was the basic tablet Fire 7 5th generation and was on sale for $29.99.

It seems a little heavier but that may be because I purchased a better case for it.  This one is a ""keeper""!",,,
2,,,,,"Terrible screen. A 720p screen is just not excusable, even in a cheap tablet like this. Even my Nook HD+ from 7 years ago had a much better screen. Aside from the screen the rest of the hardware is passable. Not annoying slow (at least not yet) and it feels decent enough. Thick bezels make it a bit difficult to hold in one hand.Software is the other major issue. Putting aside the fact that the tablet exists to push Amazon services on you, it just has a lot of annoying issues. Home screen sucks, and you can't replace it with something better. ""Blue shade"" feature doesn't actually filter blue light, it just adds an orange tint on everything, even making blacks brighter and orange tinted. No third part quick settings tiles. Various things that exist in stock android, but Amazon had to go and mess it up.And of course the biggest issue with the software is the lack of Google Play store and services. Most of the apps you want just aren't going to be on the Amazon app store. Thankfully it is possible to get the Play Store on there, but it is a rather annoying."
3,,"Great table for the price. Bought it on sale.It a great tablet if you adjust your expectations. It's amazing to play some very simple casual games, and watch movies/videos on the side. Display quality is good enough for watching most of the content inside.It's definitely not the fastest or most advanced tablet, but for its price, it provides an amazing value.",,,
4,,Awesome What a great tablet. It has a great battery life  screen and interface. The Alexa integration works great.,,,
5,"A great buy as long as you understand what you're buying... Excellent value. Solid performance, sturdy build quality. Amazon's launcher is looking a little dated, and, like all Amazon Fire tablets, this one isn't much more than a delivery vehicle for Amazon products, but it operates quickly and smoothly and provides everything most tablet buyers want.",,,,
6,,"Great value for my needs This is my second Kindle device.  I like the screen size, image quality, and functionality of system.  I use heavily for ebooks and audio books both with Amazon and local library.  I also use it for browsing and streaming videos.  I purchased the cordless charging stand.  Works great.  Excellent battery life.  Very happy with the value (reasonable price, great screen quality, adequate apps and functionality for my needs).",,,
7,,,"Great for reading a book but otherwise not so much, yet. I really like my Kindle Fire 8 Plus except...I need instructions. I'm not tech savvy and I have yet to find any kind of a manual that explains in simple language how the thing works, outside of reading a book. I used Nook for years and recently converted as I feel the Kindle has more to offer, but have learned the little I know by trial and error with a lot of frustration. Keep hoping I can find a manual that will explain functions, but until then, it gets a 3.",,

Good sound, and battery life is exceptional. Love Alexa although the question of the day reminds me that I'm not as smart as I sometimes think I am. Glad I upgraded!",,,
1,,"Love IT! This is my third Kindle and I love them.  I use mine for reading books, playing games, and just looking up information on the net.  I have gone from the 7 to the 8 this last time.

I love this thing!!",,,

After a few months, this one gets caught in a loop when the ads play after a game.  I wait for the ads to run and the screen  to go still for 30 seconds, and when I click the ""X"", the screen defaults to either the web page to purchase a game or gets stalled loading the page.  This is extremely frustrating since he previous Fire tablets I purchased did not exhibit this pattern.  And, this happens on games from various developers.  It started on one game and now it happens on all of the games.I have tried using the tablet to browse the web, but the browser loads so slowly that it isn't worth the effort.  I am disappointed and cannot recommend the tablet but anything but reading.",

3,It’s Here!!! Arrived today!  Setup was simple and larger size than old reader is perfect. It also weighs more which may be troublesome. I’m hoping the extra size and viewing features improve my reading pleasure. I’m very pleased with it.,,,,
4,,"Excellent Upgrade This version is fast and fun, and, I think, the sixth I have owned since they first came out. A couple were just for reading, one later for movie watching and the last several for listening to music. As much as I enjoy them they are hopelessly frustrating to master, particularly for listening to master. Way too many incomprehensible icons to understand. Once you do it is surprisingly simple, but getting there is a chore.",,,

2,,,"Not that great I bought this version because it had 64gbs.  Of course Amazon won't let you delete the preinstalled app (which would give you more gbs) and are mostly junk.  Also, if you have an sd card the only thing you can download onto the card are items you buy from Amazon.  The power off button doesn't work well.. It doesn't go off and when I try again it asks if you want to go to Safe Mode.  All in all it is no better than the other fire table which I own.",,

I have been using that a lot!",,,

5,,"Scammed at the last minute! Two reasons I bought this. One, it’s an upgrade to a faster processor and two its small. The kindle itself is a 5star. Lately Alexa will not shut up. I turn her off she comes back on. My KKK held shuts off and have to turn it back on. Tonight I told Alexa to shut up. Oh, she's driving g me nuts. If I could u program her I would.",,,

Well he said the screen is very clear and big enough to see without his glasses...he reads alot of news every day so he is in the know. He also had two football games going at one time. One on his phone and one on the new tablet. If I find out more I'll let you know. If he puts it down...,,,
1,,Love it!!! Needs more software functionality. I use this for my dogs movies when she feels like watching in her own space away from the TV. Very good quality. I highly recommend a case with a good stand. Worth it. Will buy many more products from Amazon!!Only problems are minor and software related. Not enough screen locking apps and the default screen lock doesn't work well with YouTube. Still worth it.,,,

3,,,It’s heavy Rechargeable holder is not as good as the price I paid.,,
4,,,"Not what I expected (and not in a good way) I received my Fire HD Plus and I am a bit disappointed. I had an Fire HD8, which I traded along with my Fire 10.  My older Fire HD8 had much better screen quality, battery life and didn't as much time it takes to download a game on this device. The touch of the screen is a bit odd. I thought that I accidentally purchased a refurbished device, however according to my order and the box it came in confirms it is new. I wish I hadn't traded my devices. However I have so I think I may send this back and get a 10.......",,

6,,,This is a Amazon device not a regular Tablet I was talked into buying this from my Brother. He said he bought one too. I was worried that it would not support the apps that i use on  my phone. It does not support the apps that i would believed to be standard like lasspass Ring LG Thinq. I brother said that you can side load the google playstore which i was not able to get to work. Please the speaker is really bad it requires a external speaker to hear alexa. I would not recommend it to anyone that is some what techy might work for OLD people though,,

Meets our basic needs for reading, simple browsing, and Amazon shopping.  Love the Alexa feature.  I know their are more capabilities, which we are slowly using.  Totally recommend but this IS NOT Apple tablet, so most apps are not available.",,,

It is NOT compatible with EXFat format.(NOTE: It took Amazon Help Desk 5 months to tell me this.)EXFat [ which was compatible with previous version Fire Table (HD7, HD8) ] is _now_ NOT compatible.  This is a  huge step backwards.I stored a lot of media to watch when travelling offline or with spotty-wifi.The largest FAT32 microSD I could find on Amazon was 32GB.It couldn't handle my 256GB microsd (EXFat) - in fact, it completely destroyed my first 256GB microsd card when it tried to format it -- NOTE: this exact 256GB microsd (EXFat) was working just fine in my old HD8 Fire.I returned my All-New HD8 Fire Tablet after finally getting the answer about EXFat incompatibility from Amazon and picked up my old HD8 Fire Tablet with its functioning 256GB microSD."

The best part is I have the capability to use my phone while using the tablet.,,,

0,,Why a Fire 8 plus? The only Con I can find is the size is a little large for comfortable holding while reading.  The cover I bought does fold to make a stand which eliminates that issue.Pros on this unit are many. Sound and video are awesome.  I am still finding my way around on it being far more used to the B&N Nook format and will definitely say that I am not sorry I switched.,,,

What you have your tablets profile set to (adult profiles on your Amazon account) is what’s logged into your prime video. This is a huge misstep in my opinion.Also on Amazon itself, you offer kid profiles, offer grandparent accounts. This way my mother can use things I have.In the meantime, I’ll use a different profile on my other Amazon products (fire stick, and app on apple products) and my mom will now use my old main account.

I’m not happy with the fact that it randomly decides to completely shut down and refuses to turn back on until I plug it back into the charger despite being over 70% charged when it shuts down.

Alexa works fine for both calling out to any USA 10 digit number and controlling Skype to use Skype to dial any 10 digit number or Skype user.

Under the heading you get what you pay for - this is that.It won't connect with Apple AirPods 2, though every other bluetooth device I have does and the screen sucks. I thought it was my eyes, but then I looked up the specs.  It's only 189 ppi.  I have an old Kindle HD 8.9 and it has 250ppi, almost the resolution of an iPad.  I thought that being it was new in 2020 the screen would be on par with other tablets.  It's not.  In low light it may make you feel like you're losing your vision.  Thankfully I compared it to my iPads and no, it wasn't me, it was this cheap-ass screen. Anything made by Apple or Samsung or even the prior HD model will blow it away.  It's not your eyes, it's cheap ass Amazon pushing the cheapest Chinese crap they can.The main advantage of a Kindle is that some of the models will read the book to you via the Text to Speech feature.  That's nice, but if you can't get it to work with what is the premier bluetooth earbuds, that can be useless.If you just want a book reader any iPad (new or old) with the free Kindle app is far superior you just don't get the ""Text to Speech"" feature.I tried to return it, but they wouldn't let me because I was 1 day beyond the return window, so their customer service sucks too!!!",

4,,,,,"Incredibly Disappointed This is - was - my third fire; I was replacing my Fire 10 with the Fire 8 for better portability and I wanted the wireless charger.  It took me a long time to decide to spend the money since my Fire 10 is still operating just fine.  So when I received Amazon gift certificates for my birthday, I thought, why not!  I ordered the Fire HD 8 Plus, the wireless charger, and a new case; I could not wait for the package to arrive.  The device is small, fits in my handbag, and has new options; I can control my Alexa devices from the screen, switch to show mode, etc.  But I can't adjust the volume to a decent level and the sound is tinny.  I like to listen to books every evening and with the cooler weather, I wanted to take advantage of my screened-in patio.  It's impossible to hear the reader unless I hold the device up to my ear.

I'll keep this short and sweet since others have written far more comprehensive reviews - even when I shut off Auto-brightness, my Kindle still decides it needs to automatically ratchet the display brightness down to 6%, rendering it useless until I shine a spotlight on it and get in to Settings so I can turn it up to where I can see it in anything other than a subterranean phosphorescent glow.Until Amazon decides to fix this, I'd recommend against buying one.

Probably just turn it into a tabletop picture viewer and buy something else. Will not buy kindle again for sure. Cant even do a simple export of Bookmarks without backing the whole thing up to Amazon (really ?). Power button also located where I frequently hit it while holding the Kindle. Just a disappointment after a good run with the last one.Update to review. Contacted by Amazon customer service after leaving review and we worked through several items I had listed. Bump up to 4 stars for customer service response and the product working within design limits.Bumped back down to 2 stars and back to a tabletop picture viewer. Just can't do much with it except view Amazon's world. Thought I'd give it another try because Amazon support was interested in helping but its just wasting my life trying to make anything work. Back on the shelf and will find another system.Update. Still irritated I wasted money on this one. Stays on the shelf most of the time as it is useless compared to the old 7th gen.",

Both have been VERY poor experiences as tablet and e-book readers. The one I bought in April has terrible screen lag and the Kindle reader app had odd screen formatting that makes the reading uncomfortable on my eyes. It also freezes occasionally for no apparent reason. NO additional apps, just the plain vanilla, out-of-box usage.The October HD 8 purchase is the latest gen, but it too has hardware issues, such as screen freezes and unable to get out of the screen lock: I put in my password but the device just goes black and then goes back to the screen lock...very odd! The Kindle app behaves erratically, as well; it too has this weird book formatting bug.I cannot recommend the HD8 due to the problems that I have experienced, but if you get one on sale, maybe you can live with its issues--or maybe you will get one that works fine.***Update 12/15/2020***I have been so frustrated with this Kindle that I have put it back in its original box; I will try to find someone who can use it and not mind the terrible issues that plague this HD8 Plus Kindle. No hard feelings towards Amazon--I simply cannot use this device happily (POOR user experience with the hardware and Fire OS). Maybe next year I will look into one of the Kindle Paperwhite devices.",

Will not connect to a TV offline If you're planning on downloading videos to this tablet to view on a trip, to hook it up to an HDMI port on a TV so more than one person can enjoy--forget it. The USB-C port is for charging only apparently. If you don't have an internet connection to live stream or cast to your TV, this device in nonfunctional for that purpose.So Amazon, one of the reasons I get Fires is because I can download movies when I'm in town and have a connection, or on the road and have a connection, then we can watch them later on a TV everyone can see. I pay a premium to belong to your Amazon club. This is a premium device so I can watch said premium things. If I can't, and you keep cutting services, shipping options, etc., why should I keep investing in Amazon products and services? I think you'll be seeing less of me.BTW, not everyone lives in the U.S. or the U.K. and have high-speed internet. In fact, here in the U.S. there are a lot of places that don't have internet at all or very little (hello!).

It consistently will drop wifi completely, or it will just hang until i put in and out of airplane mode to reset the wifi.

This is the first fire I've owned that gives you the option to restart and not just power down.The one big downside is the new button placement.

Ugh!Bluetooth to the car, Samsung worked perfect. I could scan bach and fourth, pause and have no issues. The Fire... no. If you miss part of a story you can NOT go back without opening the fire, entering the password, and then trying to do this while driving!

I will mainly use for books/Kindle.  I also do not like the way the library works on the Kindle part of it.  It's confusing.  It does not show the books you have on pre-order.  Not a fan.  I'm use to reading on my Apple I phone.  Love the way the library is set up on Apple!  Very easy to deal with.  The only reason I started using the Amazon Fire is because..... I did not want to use to much space on my phone and A lot of books are not able to be purchased on Apple yet!"
4,Just love my new kindle. Great. Love everything about it.,,,,
5,,"Nicest Fire yet! It's FAST. Loads of memory, and the battery lasts WAY longer than my old Fire 8.Great display. Fast boot time.You won't find a tablet at this price point with this performance anywhere else.With the Play Store sideloaded, it's a no brainer.",,,
6,,Excellent It's a very good and helpful product,,,
7,,"Loving the new docking station for the tablet Well it's only been a little less than a month but I'm enjoying my new tablet. I especially like the charging dock better than having to plug it in. It seems to charge quicker or it could just be me thinking that.  Anyways, I am very happy with my purchase so far.",,,
8,,,It freezes alot I like the tablet but it freezes to much but it works,,
9,,,,,"Glad it was on sale After my basic Kindle died I went searching for a new one. After consideration I figured I should go ahead and get a Fire tablet so that I would also have the additional features such as email, internet browsing, etc. Unfortunately, I have had several problems with syncing and slow connection. I have tried everything I can find and reached out to support, but so far the performance hasn't improved. My old, beat up HP tablet operates more efficiently than this Fire tablet. The Fire tablet also will chime like it's giving a notification and every time I check it, there's nothing. Every other electronic device we have runs fast and connects easily, except for this Fire tablet.Thankfully I got this tablet on sale so I'm not overly upset by it's poor performance. But basically, it will end up just getting used as a Kindle so I should have stuck with my original instinct and just purchased a new Kindle at a lower price than this Fire tablet."
0,,,,,Cheap It was slow but not a big deal given the little use i had for it and then it stopped working bought it in March 2021 stopped working in June of 2022. Disappointing.
1,,Great! My family liked it. It delivers what it promises,,,
2,,"Improved features Upgraded from 7th generation; faster speed, smoother operation with this 10th generation.",,,
3,Wouldn’t buy again. I wouldn’t buy this one again. It cuts off and is frustrating to restart. I have no idea why. I’m spoiled by the excellent quality of the one I bought way back in 2013.,,,,
4,"Would recommend! It is very fast. The battery lasts longer than my other tablet. I am still getting use to it but I like it better than my 10"" tablet. Would highly recommend!",,,,
5,"very good value I received this as a gift, its wonderful. It has the size and weight of a small book which makes this a great reader. The speakers are clear and not tinny, amazing!",,,,
6,It is a great tablet. Love everthing about it but Amazon apps doesn't have a couple of the game apps i wanted to play on it that google does have.,,,,
7,,"Excellent Product This is my third fire tablet, the first being an HD10 2015 (5th generation) and the second being a fire 7 2017 (7th generation). While I loved the first two, the fire HD plus is my favorite by far. It's much faster and the battery life is noticeable longer. I would certainly recommend the fire HD plus to anyone thinking of getting a new tablet.",,,
8,,"Great improvement I love my new 8 plus. Much faster then my old one and the battery life is great. Add in 6 months of free Kindle Unlimited and it's a great bargain. Yes the screen could be sharper and the camera better, but an excellent tablet all around. I don't mind the ads when opening my tablet or miss the google store, as I have a Samsung tablet also. Well worth the money.",,,
9,,Grandkids loved them Used for grandkids so they would have there own,,,
0,,"Nice book size I had a previous HD8 but decided to upgrade (the older one was getting too slow). This is a nice size for reading, as it is closer to the size of a paperback book (unlike the Paperwhite or the HD8). Nice and bright and capable for media.Amazon does need to open up the Google Android market via the Google Play Store, though (without having to sideload apps).",,,
1,,overall rating It is a very good product and I am happy with it,,,
2,,,"upgrade I thought it would be a good idea to upgrade my Amazon Fire.  I have only had this model for a week, so I am still getting used to it.  The one thing that bothers me is all of the icons for ALL of the apps .  I can not move or REMOVE them and the home screen is terribly cluttered.  I won't ever use some of these apps, so I wish I could remove them.",,
3,,"Nice upgrade This was a nice upgrade to my previous Fire 8 and seems to be faster and way better battery life. The OS doesn't play well with some android features I'd like it to, but it is what it is. It performs as it is touted to so far.",,,
4,Why do books download so slowly?? Loading new books always takes MUCH time!!  Often have to wait overnight to load a new book!!Am I doing something wrong??,,,,
5,Kindle Fire 8 Prefer this over the Kindle paperwhite. Easier on the eyes and better handling. Need to charge up the battery every couple of days though.,,,,
6,,"Wonderful birthday gift for any age! My daughter gave me the Fire 8 HD tablet for my birthday.  I am a dedicated reader and love the larger screen for easy reading, the long battery life, and all the other apps especially Zoom so I can visit with my grandchildren.  Best birthday gift ever!",,,
7,,"Worth the money I purchased this as my smartphone had become my go to everything.  . I watched and streamed etc.  When I saw this I was a little wishy washy about put that much onto a tablet.  Worth every penny. . Love it.  The set up was amazing inasmuch as everything of mine is hooked together, it took less than 3 minutes. . honest",,,
8,,,,Garbage The Amazon Fire HD plus tablet is the biggest piece of trash you can b  uy. Constantly loses apps you install. Example : I downloaded a song lyric app for when I perform acoustic music and and spent countless hours setting up almost 300 songs - got to my gig - opened up the Fire and every app I downloaded from the app store including my songbook vanished - as in completely gone. Buy this for your kid as s toy but dont waste your money on  this junk if you want s reliable tablet . Buy a Samsung instead.,
9,,It's assume!! It's a total gift!,,,
0,,Great tablet So far my kids love the fire hd8 plus tablets.  Battery appears the charge faster and hold a charge longer than their previous generation tablets.  I think we had like a gen 4 hd 8 and replaced with the 10th generation hd 8 plus.,,,
1,,Set it up once you get it do not let them set it up ahead of time Don't let them preset this to your account it won't work out then you spend days or weeks trying to figure out why it doesn't work and eventually you can talk to a human being at Amazon you definitely want to set it up yourself at home after you purchase it,,,
2,,"Great tablet, great price. I love it I love everything about this Tablet. It's fast powerful and looks great.",,,
3,,"Sweet My husband loves it! Me, I’m still getting used to it. It’s a little touchy when scrolling, I find it cumbersome to get to the main screen. I haven’t tried taking pictures with it yet as I prefer my phone.",,,
4,"Can't hold it. Great, but it literally slips out of my hand. I will not bring it anywhere because I am afraid of dropping it.",,,,
5,Changed charger port...not good The charging port is not compatible. New size/design.  I can no longer use charger cords that I use on my other kindle products. This means I have to carry 2 different cords when traveling.,,,,
6,,"Excellent kindle with a few changes The 8 is an excellent kindle. However the case that is included does not stand up. You will probably want to buy a different case. Also, the home page menu has been split up into three separate pages. I preferred the old interface. Otherwise it is excellent.",,,
7,,"Perfect tablet for a great price... This is the best Fire tablet I've ever bought!  And I've bought several over the years.  For myself and relatives.  The Fire HD 8 Plus is fast, the battery is long lasting and the touch screen is perfect.  I love it and plan to buy the 10"" at some point!",,,
8,,A joy to use for both reading and browsing internet This Kindle Fire HD was an upgrade from a quite old original Kindle Fire.  Such an improvement that there is no real comparison.  I am really enjoying using this tablet.  I like the night time mode that automatically adjust color and light level for reading at night.,,,
9,,"great tablet Two things that could use some improvement.  Swipe actions on the screen feel like they have a bit of drag.  My finger just doesn't glide across the screen as easily as it should.  Also, the app store needs a wider selection of apps, like the play store has.",,,
0,para mi nieto buena,,,,
1,,Great item for the price. Our second Kindle Fire. An upgrade from KF 7 inch bought 5 years ago. Alexa nice add on. Larger high RES screen super. Fair price. Our son in law got KF 10 for Christmas. Envy on my part and he loves it. He had a KF 7 before and it is still going strong.,,,
2,,Eh It’s good for books and internet browsingThat’s about it,,,
3,,,FIRE HD PLUS TOO MANY ADS.,,
4,,Big Improvement over 2018 Fire HD 8 It is faster then the previous version and doesn't hang up. The wireless charging works great and is convenient. Only downside for me is no USB file transfer.  It is annoying to have to take out the micro sd to transfer files to the Fire HD.  It also has reliable bluetooth connections with my headphones (previous HD 8 did not). Happy with my purchase.,,,
5,,Easy to use Light in weight making it easy to use when traveling,,,
6,,"Gen 10 fire. Nice upgrades to the old fire.  Got it with the hard upright charger and it sets on my night stand and functions as a clock at night.  Also, I can talk to Alexa through this Fire and play music and control lighting throughout the house that are on a smart system.",,,
7,"It is over priced It works as well as my other 8inch fire tablet,the only real difference is charger",,,,
8,Worth the cost for first tablet So far it works great. I do wish I could add certain apps I use but all in all it's a good product.😀😀,,,,
9,Sync issue I am happy wirh the quality of the Fire HD plus however I can't get it to sync with my phone.,,,,
0,,Exceptional!! Screen quality is excellent with clear rich sound!The size is perfect!,,,
1,,Awesome Compact. Powerful. Gets more than just the job done.,,,
2,,"Good Device We switched a Fire 10 Tablet to this Fire 8 Plus and you can see the performance improvement from the previous one, and the battery life is way better to. The Fire Kids feature is great and keeps the usage under control.",,,
3,,"This tablet is priced right and is high quality! Perfect! I love that I can use it for reading, surfing the net and watch a movie! The screen quality is good, the touch screen is easy to use. This tablet is lightweight and easy to use. I definitely recommend this!",,,
4,great little portable computer The swipe screen to get to home doesn't always work the first or second time you swipeI will spend more for the larger screen next time,,,,
5,,,,,"Whats the point? Other than price I can't quite figure out what is appealing about this. And value proposition is waning the more I use this.  It's is my second Fire and with a quite a few generations between them I was expecting some improvement in responsiveness. Purchased two of these along with two pairs of new Echo Dots for running music specifically in two small spaces on separate networks. Its been a less than seamless experience. Interface is extremely laggy and unresponsive and this is just using the Alexa app. Better off getting a very old iPad. In the way that things Just Work between Apple devices, Amazon devices seem to be on the opposite end of the spectrum. Even the Apple Device: Echo experience is far superior to the Fire:Echo experience.... how is this possible Amazon?"
6,,Perfect Fast shipping on a great product! Its perfect! Easy set up,,,
7,,This is great. I am always using.  Would buy another if it wasn't Christmas.,,,
8,,Great buy and exactly what I wanted. Size and weight is just right.  It works great.,,,
9,,Improved USB port. Improved. I still use my older 8. It has a weak micro USB port. Easily damaged.But I like my 8 just the same. Now this new version has a beefed up port. Not minnie. Your either a kindle person or not. I'm totally satisfied. I now have two.,,,

1,"Way better than the 7th gen Still not as fast as I had hoped, but much improved over the 7th I had - and for the price, can I really complain? No.  The charging is much faster too, via usb-c, thank you very much!",,,,
2,,"A worthwhile upgrade I traded in my Fire 7 for this new Fire HD 8 Plus tablet.  It has 64GB memory, a much longer lasting 12hr battery with wireless charging, and an improved interface, bluetooth, and will accept a microSD card for added storage.  It's also faster.  I'm happy with this device.",,,
3,,Husband loves it! I got this kindle for my husband's birthday and he absolutely loves it! It works great and he loves the sound. Its a great product.,,,
4,,"Great Upgrade I loved my 7, and used the money back opportunity to upgrade to 8.  It offers a longer and more powerful life.  I use it at nighttime next to my bed when I can't sleep.  I watch movies or read books.  Great for these especially through Amazon Prime--free.",,,
5,,"Excellent battery life! This is one of the best fire tablets ever. The battery life is excellent, and the wireless charging station wonderful! One can read at night without bothering anybody because it is well lit and it is clear to see. I use it  to read my kindle books, check my e mails, and read the latest news. And it fits in a handbag. Wonderful purchase!",,,
6,,"Better than expected I recently replaced my older Kindle Fire with a new one - could not upgrade the old one any further.  The new unit is considerably heavier than the old one, but the features are very nice.  Connection to wireless is rock solid, transfer times are lightning quick and use Alexa is a dream.  Could not be happier.",,,
7,,"Great overall. I love my new Kindle. The screen is good, but very high gloss and glare prone. I installed an anti aboard screen protector. Much better. The battery lasts all day on normal use days. It was slippery and hard to hold before I added a case. It fits nicely in my purse.",,,
8,,excelente muy buena.,,,
9,"IT was a good buy. I did not need this, but it will help me travel due to the small size and weight.",,,,
0,,,The charger cord is different for previous fire's that I have. Fire's are really nice - clean screen and easy to use.  BUT this model has a different charger cord plug compared to ANY of my other kindles - it's really a pain to have to keep track of just is one cord for just this one kindle.  I have no I ideal why such an inconvenient decision was made.  Disappointing.,,
1,,"It's good for picky/non computer people :) My husband had one of the original Kindle tablets without much memory on it.  He finally let me order this one for him and he loves it.  He likes doing jigsaw puzzles on it, the memory and the battery life are both great.",,,
2,,"Another winning Kindle This is my fifth Kindle (four of the five are still in use) and they just keep getting better.  Actually, my favorite feature of the Fire HD 8 Plus is the cordless charging stand which also comes in handy for viewing videos.  Great idea, Amazon.",,,

4,,Its fantastic Its perfect for my needs,,,
5,,Wonderful tablet This is the best tablet I've ever had. I would definitely ought to pay extra for the no ad version. I primarily use it as an e-reader and it's excellent. I enjoy using this tablet much more than my Paperwhite.,,,

7,,,Not charging It won’t charge. Ugh,,
8,,,"teething issues I already own the previous generation HD8 so I do have reasonable expectations, knowing this is not a full on iPAD replacement since cost is very low.  However, this new model has major WIFI issues, I have a 5GHz network at home and all other devices show solid connection, whereas this tablet shows very low connection & thus all apps are running slow / buffering.  I am not sure if this is a new antenna design, but one would imagine after 4+ years Amazon would manage to make their new version better than their old one.  I am very disappointed.",,

This is a great Fire...I love the bigger screen and the sound and visual quality...I mostly listen to books on my Fire and love the better tone of the speaker.....so far the battery is lasting a good long while tooand that's also very wonderful. Am so glad I upgraded!,,,

6,,,"Nice tablet but still slower than every other tablet out there!! The tablet is nice, not much different than the last one. They say it’s much faster but it really isn’t, it is so much slower than any other tablet out there, it’s frustrating to the point where I only use it for reading or games/apps. Can’t use it for the internet cause it is just too slow & too aggravating, it’s not worth it. Glad I have another small tablet for that!!",,

Easy access handling both. Perfect for purchasing groceries, items and quick fact check too!",,,
2,,,"Serviceable tablet with too many small faults Works fine, placement of the buttons and headphone jack don't make any sense in any orientation, and the plastic of the current generation is a far cry from the solid feeling Fire HD tablet I upgrade from.

6,,,BLOATED Tablet is awesome. Too much bloatware.,,
7,Has everything!!! So comfortable using this ! It has just so much to discover on the Kindle Fire!  Have been reading a lot!,,,,
8,,,,"No Ad Block applicable I loved this tablet when I first got it but after a while the ads on any website became oppressive. I suppose it is because ad blockers exist that websites have become so aggressive but when an ad takes up half of the screen or even takes up the entire screen (especially with no ""X"" button. or making the ""X"" button too small and over other press buttons.) it makes your website unable to visit with any enjoyment. Now I know this may seem off topic for this device, the problem is that this device does not allow you to add any ad blocker programs. It also wouldn't allow me to download a different web browser that actually has an ad blocker. Not surprising that the device being an Amazon product would want to force ad's upon us. I give this tablet a one star because, despite the things to love about it, you basically can't use it to look at any website without oppressive ads. Which is petty much all of them nowadays. It's a complete corporate tool designed to sell you things. Look around and purchase any other tablet that has a browser that allows an ad blocker (maybe google has one?), otherwise it will be an ad filled experience for you.",
9,Great for the money Liked the price,,,,
0,,,Bugs. Not Bunny. Buggy. Very buggy. HD quality wasnt as described either. More like 720p. I have a high speed internet connection but the quality wasn't very good and the bugs made it nearly impossible to use this tablet to its full potential. I had to return it. This was the first and probably the last Fire I'll get for a while which sucks. I was looking forward to having it last at least a few years.,,
1,,,"Good Tablet Overall We bought this tablet for our daughter after buying the Fire Tablet 7 and not being happy with it. Her Fire 7 was extremely slow and would kick her off of games frequently. After researching different ones, we went with the Fire 8 Plus because it was suppose to be 3 times faster with much more storage space. So far it's been good for her but I believe they are overpriced.",,

First, even with the updates, the volume keeps changing on me. And my hands are no where near the buttons or on-screen volume lever. Second, I have it protected with a case. I don't remember ever dropping the Kindle yet there is a long crack in the screen. When I chatted with customer service, there is nothing they can do. I truly feel either I got a lemon or they aren't making these newer Kindles as well as they used to.Every four years it seems, I upgrade to a newer Kindle Fire. So far I am very pleased with its processor, touch screen, charging time, and display. I had compared this one to a HD 8 and a HD 10. This one has the 3 Gig Ram and the other two have only 2 gig Ram."

Well, now that I've had my new Kindle Fire for a couple of months I'm STILL NOT HAPPY.  The charging is fine, the life of the battery is bad it only lasts about 5 hours.  My connection to AMAZON is bad, the connection stops and starts whenever all my other devices have NO TROUBLE connecting to AMAZON.  I'm looking for a different tablet now that is BETTER than this tablet.  I'm NOT happy, I'm disabled and can NOT save alot of money.  These Kindle Fire 8 Plus Tablets are NOT worth purchasing, PLEASE do the research for a MUCH BETTER TABLET.  GRABBAG"

I also paid extra to not have ads but they still pop up. Other than that it has a nice touch screen, sound is ok, the picture quality is not perfect(movies, videos) but doable for a tablet",,

8,,,"wish it could 'screen mirroring' when needed I really wanted to use the Tablet for the many zoom meetings I have. One of the things it doesn't do is share sound which was a negative, i.e. if I want Spotify music in the background while instructing a class, this is not possible. The other thing is to screen share to our Samsung tv. my phone does this, my lap top does, but the tablet doesn't. another bummer. other than those Zoom issues, I am enjoying my tablet.",,

Contacted Amazon support and they thought it was a defective tablet and offered and sent a new one.  Received new one and worked for a couple of days and now has same problem with search bar.  I think it is a software issue with the tablet. The only thing that i  can be done to resolve issue is to do system reset.  Which I am not looking forward to doing every couple of days.  Be sure to do a backup on Amazon Cloud if not when you do restore you will lose any custom setting such as apps, silk bookmarks etc..If Amazon technical team reads this review. I am 99.9 percent sure its happening to all tablets.  Please work to resolve this problem. If iis resolved I am very happy with tablet and would give it 5 stars."

3,,,,,"Very slow and lagging. Don't buy this. I wouldn't have bought this without trade-in credit and discount because I expected that 3GB RAM would not be sufficient to run apps flawlessly in this system where some Amazon's background services are very likely to occupy substantial portion of the RAM. Yup, I realized I was right. This device is really slow and lagging. Often you will experience tens of seconds lag (not just a few seconds!) when launching a new app or switching to a different app. If you are attracted to Fire tablet's relatively low price, pay some more bucks and go with 10-inch pro model which has 4GB RAM."
4,,Very good Nice product,,,
5,,,"HD Fire 8+ Battery life seems very good. But everyone is used to android or Apple and this is Amazon trying to be something different but the same, if that makes sense.

It alsoconsistently, at least 5 times a day, drops the internet connection andfails to reconnect. I have to restart the device just so I can connectagain. I have checked this out with my internet provider and they arenot the cause. No other devices in our household loose the connectionand the internet is active all the time. It is the Kindle that isdropping the connection. Additionally, it fails to play purchased appson a regular basis and I have to close them and restart them severaltimes before it will open the app.I dont know what to do with this Kindle since it was supposedly yourbest one and based off its performance, I will never purchase one again.",

When we purchased this new version, all things went south. I was unable to read an online paper that the previous Kindle had no problem with. The internet signal in rooms away from the router was weak and intermittent. My other devices connected without problem. An Amazon tech was unable to remotely connect to troubleshoot. So we returned the Kindle and receive new ones. Some things improved but the internet signal is still weak and pages load much more slowly than before. Often it is unable to open the email server. One can still read a book but other features are not nearly as good as with our older models. Bottom line is we wish we hadn't exchanged the Kindle that worked well for tis newer model. A real step backwards."

Attempts to shut off the chime sound have been fruitlessBuy . Online fixes don't work. If you look at the history of this product you will see that these are not new issues. Lots of people deal with this. Many give up. Apparently Amazon doesn't feel like fixing it. They just keep churning out the defective products.I'm going to buy an Ipad.
7,,All-new Fire HD 8 Plus tablet I love it. Amazon had already programmed just for me so I didn't have to do very much to setting it up.

I knew the apps would be a little limited.... But this was a huge disappointment for me.  Really good for watching movies and reading Kindle books.

This happened when taking it off of the wireless charger. I haven't had the problem again. I believe this will be an issue because I have had very little time with the unit.",,

0,,,,,"Disappointed with the utility of the tablet The tablet itself is fine but it appears to have been designed in such a way to discourage use of non-Amazon applications. For example, there does not appear to be a way to put use a security system such as Norton or MalwareBytes. The notion that the built-in Amazon security is adequate does not pass muster for professional use. It is not a good substitute for either a regular Android Tablet or an IPAD.  Nor is it as good a reader as a Kindle. I would not have made the purchase if I had known these issues.  It does look nice on the table though."

Called vs we took it back to factory settings and restarted. This did not fix problem. Called again and was told to send it back they would fix problem.

The tablet needs to have the google play store without having to side load it because the Amazon app store is trash.I shouldn't have to pay extra to remove ads either. It should come without ads out the box instead of me having to make a choice to pay more to remove ads.,,

3,,,,"Poorest performing Kindle I've had in 6 years It loads incredibly slowly.Sometimes, the only way I can get a book to load at all is to click into the store and click on READ NOW in that window.At any given time, 10-25% of my books show as gray rectangles instead of book covers, which makes the grid view useless.The change in format from the old carosel style to the Home/Library style seems to serve no purpose. Instead of swiping to audible, now I click to the library, scroll down to audible, click again on audible (wait a year for it to load), click on the book I want to listen to (wait two years for it to download). It's an extra step that serves no purpose. I didn't have trouble finding audible on the Kindle before, thnx, you just added an extra step, and since I have to wait a year for it to do ANYTHING, you just increased the inconvenience substantially.I pay for very fast internet, which pays off in general, but makes no difference with the Kindle. I wish I had returned it. I'm shopping now for a Samsung tablet. I won't buy a Kindle again.",

6,,,,,"My last Kindle Fire, not in a good way The hardware may be capable, though power management in standby is atrocious, burning through 10%+ on days it sits idle with the cover closed. The usual Kindle layer on top of Android manages to break the functionality of Amazon's own apps that work on Android. The worst of these is the Shop Amazon program that isn't an app at all, but built into the UI. Buggy enough that it is mostly limited to partial status of orders placed and adding things to your shopping cart to make purchasing on a different device a little faster when you can use it. (If you need to change method of payment from a default to other methods listed, you cannot. When/if it lets you shop Whole Foods, it breaks in the middle and cannot place the order.  When there are Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh related errors in the app, it think it is an Apple iPad and recommends that you buy a better Android device for your shopping needs.)"

I don't like the position of the on button. I've pressed it at times when trying to change the volume. It also seems to shut off more than it should.

I thought an 8+ with the extra RAM would do the trick.  I read about the lackluster reviews but hoped my experience would be better.  I've owned 6 Kindles and Kindle Fires so I've been a fan and always thought they were good products for the money.The Kindle Fire 8 gen 10 has missed the mark.  It was sooooo slow and unresponsive. After the first full install and transfer, it was torture. I even did a factory reset just to test it without any apps on it.  Web browsing was like a 2002 modem speed.  Apps were slow to load.

Did not purchase extended warranty because we had had no problems for 6 years.Warranty expired on April 2nd and on May 2nd I started getting a warning that charging port port was being disabled because moisture or liquid was being detected.Unit was never exposed to water.  Used indoors and stored in a storage ottoman on blankets when not in use.When I 1st contacted Amazon I was told it was a known issue and that a new update might take care of it.  I downloaded the update and the message disappeared for a week or so.  It is back and now amazon is offering 15% off a new one.  Been there done that with other purchases (not Amazon) that go defunct a month after the warranty-extended or not.  It should have been a warning that company only stands behind their product for 3 months.It was a nice product while it lasted, but will just go back to my old kindle and not worry about library books.",

1,,Nice for “on the go” or easy listening at night! I like the portability of this tablet and definitely the volume output. However when holding this tablet the sides are so smooth that one could easily drop the tablet. It would have been nice to have some rough groove designs on both sides of this tablet to allow for better gripping when holding the tablet.,,,

Won’t charge, won’t hold charge, won’t connect to our WiFi after multiple attempts to reset it, won’t load apps then won’t automatically reconnect to the internet after restarting to fix that issue. Argh! My kids can at least play games offline when the tablet actually starts properly, I guess. The screen and touch features are actually really nice, so the system issues are that much more aggravating! Buy a different tablet if you actually expect to use online features."

I have now been on Chat help (fourth customer rep) for 2 hours with no resolution.***********Original review 10 January 2021***********Purchased an Amazon refurbished Fire tablet. It arrived a day early, but came with the wrong charging cable - a micro USB instead of a USB-C. I contacted Amazon and they had me order the correct cable, in which they would refund the amount. Luckily, the tablet arrived charged, so I began the setup process. After connecting to my home wifi, I began to register the product. I received the One-Time Password (OTP), entered it, and then received an error message to contact Amazon support. First message at 0933, by 1025 I was told to wait 24 hours to re-contact Amazon because the service rep could not do anything.Poor QA/QC when shipping and poor customer support that I leaving me with a brick.If you purchase refurbished, open immediately to check that all items are present and that you can get the item fully functional. I'm glad this was not given as a gift, as this would have been embarrasing.Rep placed an order for another Fire Tablet to be delivered.",
9,,,,"Unhappy What I dislike was lack of ease in using. I’ve had several kindles and loved them all. fir was not easy. I got stuck in setting up and tried to get help. I’m now being charged $46 per month for that one question and Amazon is charging my bank for all those games that pop up, which I did not approve. It’s very complicated to maneuver. I put it aside an ordered an IPad, also from Amazon. I’ve been a long time customer but now I feel I’m being victimized.",
0,,,All that glitters is not gold I have had many fire kindles and finally decided to purchase the add free version. I love no adds but I don't  like not being able to sync all my devices to it. I have literally hundreds of audiobooks and thousands of books. So imagine my surprise when none ofvthem transfered! So be ware!,,

I've restarted several times now.",,
0,,,,"Kindle's ONLY Text-to-Speach option FAILS! I'm a Truck Driver obsessed with Nonfiction Audiobooks. Some books are NOT available in the Audible format. So I have BOTH an iPhone, and an Android smartphone so that I can have access to all the audiobook formats, and podcast formats. Amazon does NOT enable the Text-To-Speach option on the Kindle app on any of these devices on purpose in order to force you to buy a Fire Tablet. I bought the Fire Tablet exclusively for its Text-to-Speech option on Kindle eBooks. This was a mistake because the Fire Tablet does not allow you to set the display screensaver timeout for longer than 30 minutes, and the Kindle Text-To-Speach function shuts off when the screen goes dark. I drive 10 hours a day, this makes the Fire Tablet dangerous as an audiobook device while I'm driving. I have to push several buttons each time it shuts off in order to get it to start playing the book again, and even then, it doesn't keep track of where I was in the book. When I restart the Text-To-Speach option it usually starts several pages back from where I was before. This is frustrating, time consuming, dangerous while driving, and totally worthless for me as a audiobook sevice which was the ONLY reason I bought the Fire Tablet.",
1,,Faster than 7 Love my fire 8 plus.  I have not tried a lot of it’s features to be honest.  Games I played on my 7 started crashing or freezing.  No issues with the 8.  Faster.  Has not dropped my WiFi.,,,

5,,Muy bonito y muy facil de entener Todo me agrado,,,
6,,,,Junk and they don’t stand behind it Do not buy this Kindle Fire tablet. I have one of the first Kindle Fires that ever came out and works perfectly. We bought a 10” and an 8” when they “upgraded” them a few years later and are absolutely worthless. They are super slow and drain the battery horribly. Since then my Mom has purchased a couple of the newer ones so we thought we would try it again. Well we just bought this in May and maybe used it 5 times. Went to use it and the battery is dead and it won’t even take a charge. Customer service says sorry 90 day limited warranty is up and you can buy at new one for 15% off. Oh and they changed the charge port shape so out of 6 Kindle Fire charge cords we can’t use any of them on this new style.  Don’t waste your money!  Disgusted that they don’t have a 1 year manufacture warranty like anything else anywhere else. Go back to your first design of the Fire Amazon.,
7,,,"Screens very different from last Kindle Fire The screen quality and battery life are much better than the last Kindle Fire I had.  The screens however are very busy with movement and apps that I don't and probably won't use.  Very annoying and some of the apps I can't seem to get rid of.  There's way too much going on, and I don't think as user friendly as in the past.  My husband and I each bought one, and he's not using his new one at all. Disappointed.",,

I had to send back the first case and reorder another version.",,

7,,,Surprisingly slow I mean you can’t complain about a $100 tablet. But the Alexa app won’t open. It just crashes. It’s surprisingly slow. But eventually it will only be a dashboard / dakboard.Just don’t expect to get your wig blown back by it.,,
8,,"Very pleased One of my other kindles is so slow to boot and navigate and sync that it was the reason I purchased this new fire. It’s fast, great screen quality and it syncs with my original kindle and my iPad. So happy I made this decision.",,,

4,,,,"Horrible tablet, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! I have owned several kindled and I must say the kindle 8 plus is an absolutely horrible piece of junk, the power cable is different so none of my longer cables will work, the volume/speakers/sound quality is practically non existent so you have to download a volume booster app, and sometimes for no reason the screen locks up while watching videos and requires a restart. Plus I have not been able to find a decent case for it so that it will stand up on my end table for watching videos, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY HATED THIS THING FROM DAY 1, DEFINITELY WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!! JUNK.JUNK.JUNK!!! Going back to my cheaper Kindle 7 it's a much better tablet at a much lower price.",

1,,,Limited app availability and grainy screen I don't like that you don't have as many apps available as one would on the google app store. The screen is grainy as well. The sound is fantastic however. I wouldn't buy again. It does not support what I like and has less utility because of it.,,

5,,,Computer will not reconize the Kindle Fire 8 Plus with SD card. The only dislike I have with this Kindle Fire 8 Plus. You can't move any file either to the kindle itself or the SD card via plugging it into the computer. Like the previous Kindle Fire I had. When plugging it into my computer. The computer did recognize the Kindle and the SD card. So moving or copying files was easy.This is the only downfall I don't like about the Kindle Fire 8 SD.,,

One of the triggers for me is the news. I avoid it at all costs. This device, on the “for you” section (which I want to use for suggestions and whatnot)  splashes trending now news and news videos throughout and there is no way to turn it off. I’ve talk to a couple support people now and they got nothing for me on it. You can not delete the news app either it’s all connected. I should be able to customize this devise better. I bought it to read books and have easy access to my prime content, not as a news source. Fix this issue and it’s a five start device."

0,,,,,"Not an upgrade I bought to replace an aging, but functional, Fire HD.  It has trouble maintaining WiFi conection where I work while I have not other problems with multiple other devices( i-Pad, other FIre HD and my previous Fire).  The on/off and volume button locations seem to be had to access with a case.  It's a bit smaller than my other Fire, but that's okay because I like the compact size to fit in my bag."

3,,,"If you're happy with the 7, no need to switch Frankly, I was expecting more like a much brighter screen and definitely more than 3 gb of ram.  Including an sd card would have been nice. If you have the 7 and are happy with it, no need to switch.",,

But the screen is not very good quality, and more importantly, the processor is not good and I had a lot of lag even just browsing the web with a few tabs. I returned it and got a Fire HD 10 (2019) instead, and I am much happier with it.",,
6,,,,"Only Lasted Six Months Normally, I do not write reviews, however, my experience with Amazon regarding this product is very upsetting. I purchased two of these tablets for my grandsons for Christmas; both were brand new. I also bought screen protectors and a protective cases. They use them often, but not daily, mainly for educational games and activities. After six months, one of the tablets has failed to power on and will not charge. We've tried different chargers, etc., and when nothing else worked, I contacted Amazon for support. After suggesting different ways to turn the tablet on and finding it wouldn't work, their suggestion was to buy a new tablet.  I am extremely disappointed since I honestly believe a tablet should last more than six months, especially with limited use. The other tablet is still working, however, with this type of support for their product, I cannot recommend the fire tablets as there is no guarantee they will work for a reasonable length of time and sadly, Amazon obviously will not stand by their product. Therefore, if you happen to get a ""lemon,"" you will simply lose the money you spent.",

4,,Size is important!  fits in my hands perfectly. I really like this tablet. Nice size & easy to maneuver around in.The subjects I only gave 4 stars is because I haven’t used my tablet every day to know how long the battery life lasts & haven’t taken any pictures yet. Its my go-to device while my phone charges up.,,,
5,,Granddaughters happiness so far a perfect ten I bought two of these for both of granddaughters and there birthdays are six weeks apart. But so far the first one I have no issues with. It is a lot faster than the older one I have bought them. The oldest one walks around hers everywhere she goes and has no complaints either.,,,

8,,,,,"Pretty Disappointed Pretty disappointed in this product. First tablet showed up with a cracked screen, we were able to have it replaced. The replacement tablet worked great for the first little bit and then we started getting a message that there is water in the charging port. Now I know for a fact no water got into the port. Upon Googling, I found that this is a semi common problem, and no one has figured out a solution to the problem. This is a reoccurring problem, sometimes it will charge with no problem, but more often than not we get this message. I haven't been able to charge this tablet in 3 days. Feels like such a waste of money 😕"

I got this with the echo pods or however they are called, it doesn’t pair with it at all because of the Alexa app not being able to update with it. So I highly recommend not to get it the the echo pods deal because of that."

6,,Excelente tablet ,,,
7,,,,DON’T BUY THESE TABLETS After purchasing this tablet I have had nothing but issues with it.  Since it was purchased as a Christmas gift I preloaded it before I gave it.  (It worked fine)  The new owner started experiencing problems with it at approx. 3 months of use.  She thought she may have had a bad charger as it was always turning off.  We changed chargers and she still experienced the same issues but now it wasn’t even coming on.  She brought it to my attention and after doing all the trouble shooting tips with the Amazon rep. They told me it was out of warranty and could only offer me a 15% return.  Warranty was for 90 days and at 5 months now I have a tablet that I can’t even use.  I spent a lot of money for a pos item that can’t even be used for 6 months.  Amazon knows that they are having issues with these machines and should be replacing them not taking peoples money for 5 months.  DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE TABLETS OR ANY OTHER AMAZON PRODUCT IF THEY WONT STAND BEHIND THEM.,

4,,,,"DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS WITHOUT MOBILE PHONES Amazon no longer permits account creation without the use of a mobile phone number. I purchased this Amazon Kindle 8 HD for my father for Christmas, and was disappointed to discover that I required a mobile number to set the device up. We live 15 miles from the nearest store, and mobile phones don't work within miles of our house. Because of that, we DO NOT OWN mobile phones. I wasn't able to set the device up, even after trying for over an hour. Amazon claims that this is a security measure, however it seems more like a fishing expedition for phone numbers to send text ads to. Two step verification could easily be achieved by sending a code to a landline, and the mobile requirement is completely unnecessary. There is no option for setup without one, no option to skip that step. Its either give Amazon your mobile, or no Kindle setup. Making an account with Amazon should be easy, but just isn't anymore.",

My order shows that I am eligible for replacement through September 13, 2021, but I spent over an hour with Rajalakshmi, in ""Customer Service"" who refused to provide me any service beyond offering me a 15% discount that wouldn't even bring the price to what I originally paid due to the price increases. I sent him proof that my device was eligible for replacement and he still refused to make it right.

It took me 2 hours of hacking to get regular Google Play installed for all the books I bought over there.Amazon restricts Google Play and instead shoves stupid ads all day on the lock screen.  Kinda gross.  So even though the tablet is fine...I would never buy another one.,,

2,,,Not that much of an improvement I took a chance and traded in a older Fire that I never used due to it being somewhat slow and limitations when it came to software and apps. I thought maybe the increase in RAM would solve some of the lag but no such luck. I realize you get what you pay for but the new Fire HD is not worth the money considering the aggravation of its lack of responsiveness. I went ahead and returned it.,,

4,,,"Its ok. Comes loaded with Bing, enjoy that. Its glitchy and glitchy. You'll see what I mean. As an e reader its a little touchy but it gets the job done. I'm still using it, and stand by the product, but disappointed in the operating issues that I can't fix.",,

3,,,"Great for Amazon Users So tried this Amazon tablet and overall I enjoyed it when it came to Amazon services like Amazon Music, Audible, and even Kindle.

3,,,,"Device bricked less than a year later Being locked into rather limited Amazon's app store was one thing, but having the tablet refuse to boot and just show me the Amazon logo less than a year into owning the tablet was enough to make me never want to buy another Amazon device.Tech support was very little help and gave up after having me force reboot (which I had already tried to no avail). I had also tried restoring factory settings on my own (tech support didn't even try suggesting this) which also didn't work. I was offered me a 20% off coupon towards purchasing a NEW fire tablet, for my trouble, but I opted instead to buy from one of their competitors.",
4,Ipad mini alternative great deal,,,,
5,,,,25 months in  battery is swollen fire hazard This product was fine for just about 2 years.  My wife & kids loved it.  It started falling off the dock and I realized the battery had become swollen.  It is an explosion risk and fire hazard.  I contacted Amazon on June 30th and it hasn't been resolved yet.  I want the item out of my house.I suspect the wireless charging dock they sold me with it never stops charging the battery. Probably could be addressed with a software fix.I do not recommend the wireless charging dock,

I kept looking for a setting to remove and couldn't find one.  A quick internet search showed that the ""special price"" listed was not a sale but a deception to allow them to have advertisements indefinitely on your device.  It cost me 15 additional dollars to have them removed.",,

Once in a while it will come on and work for a short time and then die again. It’s been fully charged, reset, all the things but nothing works so it is not a good product. I will also add that my daughter is responsible with electronics and it was in a Amazon cover/case as well.Called Amazon and they said i was beyond the return window (at 3 months since I bought it a month before Christmas so only 3 months of use). They wanted me to buy a new one! So if you only need to use this for 2 months then you’ll be fine, otherwise DO NOT waste your money!!",
0,,Wonderful Love it so far. Got it for Christmas and I’m not disappointed. I only got it for reading purposes not for anything else. It’s so worth it. Wish I got it sooner.,,,

How is that possible, i dont know. Other than that its ok, but decent for the new lower price. The camera still sucks though. Even other cheap tablets have somewhat better cameras. Maybe next years version since video chats are now essential.",,

8,,Good tablet.  Works nice with amazon prime Like the battery life.  I used to have a nook and the battery didn’t last near as long. I don’t like all the advertisements that appear when you first turn it on.,,,
9,,,,,"IF I want a advertisement tablet,  I wouldn't pay for it The specs on this tablet is very impressive, but turns out this is a advertisement tablet.  Meaning from the time you turn it on/wake it up,  you get advertisements.  IF its an advertisement tablet,  I sure wouldn't pay for it.  The size is good, speed is great,  battery life is good.  Not much cheaper then other comparable tablets so do I want to deal with all the advertisements? no thanks."

It repeatedly fails to charge when I plug in the chord.There have also been issues with books not refreshing and not showing up in the library. Never had these issues with any previous Fire 8, and I've owned many. Overall, it seems like an upgrade that is actually a downgrade, as happens so often these days."
3,,Kindle HD 8Plus Amazon has improved the Kindle HD8 plus to near perfection!  Well done!  No negative issues found…just improvements were made!,,,
4,2020 Fire tablet (8 inch) More responsive than the last generation (2018). Would be better if it worked with Google play store,,,,

7,,,,,Only a snail is slower. I've wanted a Fire 8 Plus for some time because it has 3gb RAM pre-installed. But the quad-core processor is SLOWER than any cheap throw away tablet. My 5 y/o Asus S 8.0 is faster than this. I'm seriously considering returning it. Everything else about it is good but it takes 45 sec-1 min to load any screen/page? Not acceptable. Oh how I want to like this tablet

3,,"Good affordable tablet Works very well, especially considering the price point. Remember, apps come from the Amazon store rather than the Google Play Store, so bear that in mind.",,,
4,,,,,Super Restrictive Use I made the mistake of thinking I'd be able to study for classes with this device. But it's so restricted that I can't view any of my course textbooks on the device. I can't download any apps such as Yuzu or Canvas college app. The Amazon app store doesn't have anything I can use for my intended use. I also can't get the  Google Play store (which has a much wider selection of apps) from the device. I'll need to look for a tablet that is more versatile.
5,,"Simply the best Ereader experience Love it, upgraded from a 7th generation Fire HD 8 and this one is notably faster. Love this decide and highly recommend the 8"" size for serious readers as the 10"" becomes to overbearing to handle with a single hand.",,,
6,,,,,Known Issue It is extremely frustrating when you plug the tablet in for the very first time and it won't charge.  When I go online to research the problem I find that it is a known issue without a fix. I was able to reset it to get it to charge but it has been the same hassle each time I need a charge.
7,,It's faster! I really like it! Plus I got the 256g memory card as well.  Helps when your ebook library has over 16000 ebooks!,,,
8,,,,,Screen broken even with a case and screen protector! Purchased my kids the kindle fire HD 8 and very disappointed.  The devices both have screen protectors and cases to protect them.  My kids do not rough handle their devices but they are kids and accidents happen.  Today we replaced the screen protector and when we pulled it off the device the kindle screen was cracked.  We have never had a screen crack while using a case or screen protector until now.  It is really disappointing to take precautions to protect the tablets and end up with a broken screen.  We have been long time users of the kindles as they tend to be a bit my rugged than other tablets but we a very disappointed in the screens on the new ones.
9,,Great product Beside reading I love to color. There are sites that you can color. It is very relaxing. Great screen quality. I love the battery life also.,,,

3,,,,"Disappointed, Don't buy... I use my Kindle for Audible books and this tablet is virtually useless. It turns the audible book off after about 20 minutes, under every circumstance. I have talked to Kindle support, audible support and actually have returned and replaced this same tablet. And nothing worked. So, I have purchased a generic tablet and will be cancelling Audible and going to a different service. This is my tenth Kindle and I was as loyal as anyone could be.  However, in 2020, I returned two 10 inch ones for poor mechanical quality, and one of these and the result was further trouble with the tablet.  I am sorry this has ended this way.  I have truly loved my Kindles and Audible book, but no longer. (Support tried their best, but the techs I talked to were not happy with the fixes for my issue and I came to believe that there is no fix for it...audible and kindle support....) Edited to Add: Months later, I try it on occasion....and nothing has been done, not an update on the Audible app, nothing at all.  Don't buy it...it is sheer junk, a useless tablet.",

9,,,,,"The worst kindle I've owned so far. I've had many kindles in my lifetime. This is 3rd Fire I've bought. While price/quality/features ratio can be justified, I have told myself that this is the last kindle I will ever buy.  The default screen and shortcuts have been modified to the point that I can't find apps in places I normally would. The kindle does not work well w/o wifi. As in - it freaks out and demands wifi to ""finish set up"" even though it has been set up months ago. I can go on and on. Splurge and buy a normal tablet or (if you are buying it just for reading) buy a cheaper version just for reading and do not bother with a Fire."
0,,Good value This tab is faster and comes with USB C which fits all my currant chargers. I also charges inductively.  For the money you can't beat it.I installed Gmail and the google play store so I could get my email and use my chrome browser. Very happy.,,,
1,,,,,"New but yet defective After having a few days, the ""new"" Fire 8 Plus tablet I received started to freeze while I was reading books on it. I was unable to turn pages without turning the unit off and then restarting it. It became worse each day to the point I decided to return it. I'm lucky I have an I-pad Mini 4 to use as a backup; at least it doesn't freeze up while reading with it. I preferred the Fire, but it was the third Kindle I had, starting with a paper white (died 2 years use); Fire 7 (died 2 1/2 years use). Then the Fire 8 Plus, with only a week or so use and starting to freeze up. Not a very good track record for the Kindle, so I-pad mini 4 it is for me."

8,,,,,Got this tablet two months ago and it no longer works I got this tablet two months ago and it no longer works. I wanted one with the special charger for my autistic child because he’s damaged other tablet charging  ports and this prohibited it from having a special case to protect from drops so I bought the only case I could find that would work. It stopped often while he was playing and he dropped it  and the screen shattered and it is unusable in many fragments with lines running through the screen. We will be buying only kid tablets from now on.

1,,Very good product I traded an older tablet in for this one and I'm glad I did. It works very well and I am quite pleased with it. Getting the maximum memory available was worth the extra cost.,,,
2,,,,,"It works but the browser is crippled. Also, won't xfer files They only allow one browser, their own, and it's nearly useless since you can't import passwords, even with a HTML file. All my important sites have long, special-character passwords, and I'm not going to copy them all to put in their crappy browser. Let us get Chrome so I can use my passwords again. Also, I tried xferring some training vids and it won't connect to windows 10 and its dropbox app has no download feature. Useless for training vids, which was a major reason for getting it. It's good for a toy, I guess."

It did load and worked originally, but stopped after a short time. Really frustrated.I also find navigating on this model more difficult. And the brightness level fades and brightens on its own.",,

Expect to enjoy for many moons.William",,,
9,,,,"Broken within a year This device broke less than a year after we got it. Amazon does not stand by their produce and will be not repair the device. It does not charge or turn on. Their only option is for me to receive a discount on purchasing another one. Which doesn't make sense because 1. I can't afford a new one and 2. I am now scared it will break outside of their 90 day warranty replacement. Apple has a better warrant policy. It is almost worth just having up money to buy an iPad that I know will be covered. They refuse to help or let me send it in for repair. I appreciate Nisar Ahmad (who ""helped us"") ofter a discount on a new product, but it defeats the purpose. So BEWARE buying this or any other amazon product. If it breaks 91 days after you by it, you are SOL.",
0,,You won't regret buying I've always had a kindle. I love this one. I'm hardly on my computer am usually on kindle or phone. I did add Google Play to it. Now best of both worlds. Lol.,,,
1,,,,,"Don’t fall for the trade-in scam! My old Fire 8  was a couple of years old, and seemed a little slow, so when I saw Amazon was offering a $25 trade-in credit, I decided to take it. It was in perfect condition, and charged with no problem, so given the option of taking $10 if they didn’t like it, I asked for it to be returned. I even charged it fully before I shipped. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised when Amazon said that it wasn’t holding a charge and they were taking back the credit, but I was. Incidentally, I still haven’t gotten my old Fire backHere’a the kicker: the “new” Fire 8 is barely an improvement."
2,,"Love my new Kindle 👍👍 I liked everything about it. A very good upgrade. Battery seems to last for hours and hours, even after playing games, coloring and using the internet on and off all day. I’ve always liked IPads better, but this Kindle is comparable to my newest mini IPad.",,,

1,,,,"Speakers defective Beware the Shoddy Speakers!Purchased this as a gift for my mother-in-law in late December and received it January 3. She takes very good -careful care of all of her technological devices, so this Fire tablet never got wet OR was mishandled in any way.In Early March the speakers stopped working,completely. After four hours on the phone with tech support, and a reset and restore- The speaker still don’t work and they are not honoring the warranty that I purchased.Even without the faulty technology, be aware that even when you purchase the non-ad supported version, all this tablet does is push Amazon apps -Amazon music- Amazon store- Amazon Alexa.The screen is neither bright nor non glare- in fact it’s quite reflective when you look at it in any kind of light.The battery level wasn’t bad as long as you weren’t using video or messenger or anything streaming over the Internet.I suppose for $125 it’s OK, but why not spend a little bit more and get some thing that might last you six months.",

6,,,,"No Power nor Backlight As with many Kindle devices, this FIRE HD  Plus' backlight went black.  I followed all the normal procedures for ensuring battery was fully charged, and then took normal steps by pressing power button until device was truly off.  Hit power button, all I got was no light but slightly visible time showing in light grey.  Tried many times but nothing worked.  Called Amazon tech after waiting a lifetime for them to answer.  Explained the issue, they said they understood, please hold and I will be back shortly to help you.  Finally, after 10 min on hold the line went dead. Par for the course in my many years dealing with Amazon.  Of course, no call back.  This device is literally the lifeblood for my 102 year old mom.  She is deaf and has very poor hearing, but with the kindle letters large, she can read, and she can play (very well) the games... all day long.  Now what?  I'm sure Amazon will delete this review as they have with others, when they are critical of Amazon.",

She soon discovered that the app was unusable: crashed almost immediately upon opening.  After days of troubleshooting and hours online with Amazon tech support, we have been informed that the app is faulty and we will have to deal with Fox's app developer.  I have no confidence this will lead anywhere.  So my wife is extremely disappointed and we are stuck with a product that doesn't meet our needs.  I believe Amazon has some responsibility to vet 3d party apps before introducing a new product.  This clearly wasn't done in this case.  If you have an interest in Fox News, DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
0,,,,"Totally worthless. Just a scam-azon marketing tool. This tablet is waaaay overpriced. It's basically not functional except with anything Amazon, which makes it an Amazon marketing tool. Why isn't it free???? It's such a piece of crap. The product description didn't mention that you can't use the Google App store or any other app store. What a joke. This isn't a tablet. Just another reason I call Amazon ""Scam-azon"" instead. I should have bought the Samsung tablet and that's what I recommend you do as well. Now, like with most products on scam-azon, I'm forced to either waste a bunch of time trying to return the junk they sent me, find a use for this paperweight, or give it away so I don't have to look at it every day. Bezos should have accounted for all of the unsatisfactory customer transactions in his last shareholder letter. He'd find the value proposition of scam-azon is much lower. Let's be real, they started as an online book store and that's really all they're good at. Everything else is just brainwashing and hype. Thanks for the worthless piece of junk scam-azon.",

2,So far so good! 😁 So far so good!😁,,,,
3,,,,,"Disappointing, Slow, & Laggy I was so disappointed with the Fire HD 8 Plus.  Sadly, its size makes it very uncomfortable to hold.  Too big to hold like a phone, but too small to actually hold by the edges.  It's so slow and laggy. I may be too much of an Apple fan/user to be fair.  I just feel like it is about as slow as my 10 year old iPad. Will be returning."
4,,,lack of compatable apps Over all the kindle 8 plus is a great kindle BUT lacks app's compatable! I have apps that i purchased on old kindle 7 that DO NOT WORK NOR COMPATABLE on the new kindle 8. APP's that i paid for are now a waste of money for i cannot use it!,,

5,,,,,"Only good for Amazon streaming items I bought this to stream football on the Yahoo Sports App.  After HOURS of trying to figure out how to go about doing this (this tablet is pretty much only AMAZON product friendly), it would not play because it ""could not find my location"".  Everything was turned on/enabled for this to happen.  The streaming of everything was SO SLOW.  Terrible.  Unless you only plan on shopping/using Amazon products (and even still maybe don't because the streaming is terrible & slow), do NOT buy.  I returned mine within a week of receiving it.  It does have good picture, however if things take forever to load/play, that is really a moot point."

5,,Good Good,,,
6,,,,"You don't want this piece of junk! Was supposed to be an upgrade from a ""wonky"" gen 7 Fire 8... Hah! It's so bad that I ended up resetting/restoring the gen 7 (which apparently got rid of the failed update that caused a permanent update-loop...) More storage and a faster processor should run faster right? Nope! Slower!  And Prime Video freezes the video (but not sound) like a Win95 media player with a buggy codec (remember switching to WinAmp 'cause M$ Media Player sucked dead mice through a garden hose? Yeah, it's that bad). And the WiFi? Very slow downloads and constant buffering with streaming media (maybe part of the problem with video?) Of course Amazon will reject this review just like they reject returns on this one day old bricked tablet...(Update) after going rounds with customer (non)support and numerous resets it was admitted to that IMDB-TV and other non-amazon ""premium"" channels are disabled intentionally even though ""available"" through Prime Video and that video failures on Prime movies are ""an unfortunate side-effect"" of this ""feature""",

5,,Big change My new Fire is so fast!  The screen is much clearer and I'm enjoying reading so much more,,,
6,,,,,"Wanted to like it but... It looks nice and it's fast. I knew I would have to side load Google play. I did, but it was not a straight forward process, but that's on me.My two big issues are icons and the kindle app that comes with this tablet. The icons do not stay in place. They shift every time a new app is added. Makes it confusing to locate an app because it's not where you think you left it.More importantly, the pre-installed Kindle app does not have ability to to move books into Collections. I have about 200 books. The only way to keep track of them is by grouping them into collections.It's a nice little tablet for the money, but not close to what I was looking for."

3,So Lovely I love my tablet,,,,
4,,,,"Too restrictive to be worth purchasing. We bought 4 of these tablets so that our children could have tablets to play games and watch their favorite shows on.  They were so excited to get them because this meant they could watch different shows from each other.  The big issue I have is that Amazon has these incessant need to make everything Fire.  They can't just use android and make these tablets actually worthwhile.  There is a devastatingly massive hole in the things the amazon App Store is missing and the Silk Browser is a joke.  So many websites don't function and those that do often tell you to use a different browser (which you can't).  I asked someone at tech support for help with trying to figure out an app and they tried to sell me a Fire TV.  I am literally appalled at that.  I understand that companies try to sell you on everything, but to tell me that the solution to fixing something on my child's tablet is to get a device for my television?",
5,,"Love it! This is my 4th Kindle Fire.  A great improvement.  All prior Kindles eventually had charging problems with inserting the cable and making contact.  With the wireless charger, it's wonderful.  Hopefully, this will be my last Kindle!",,,

This display is not quite as sharp but what's worse is the ads that pop up and especially how long they are and for most, there is no quick way to get rid of them, you just have to suffer through them. I didn't think thus would bother me because I had them before but not to the extent and length on my new device."
7,Fire My speaker stop working after a week.,,,,
8,,,,,SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW Fast and responsive it is not.  Alexa is near worthless.  All I wanted was a small 8 inch tablet with a decent screen and the ability to add memory that was not painfully slow and non-responsive. In this instance 2 out of 3 won’t cut it.  Once again I will be looking to replace a fire tablet with something more useable

3,,,,"The speakers/webcam are in the wrong locations!!! In previous versions of this tablet, the webcam was on the side, enabling the tablet to be positioned in a case, with the speakers facing down.  Now, the speakers and webcam are located at the top of the tablet.  When the tablet is in a case, the speakers now point up and away from you.  The volume is much lower than when the speakers were pointing down and towards you.  If you place the tablet in a case where the speakers can face down, then the webcam is at the bottom of the screen, which means it's pointed up your nose and at the ceiling!!!  Who in the heck designed this???  Come on Amazon, you've been making tablets for over a decade!!!  Where are your engineers???  Will this issue be fixed on the next version of this tablet?",
4,,,,,"Terrible, Bezos should have egg on his face for this monstrosity! However, this device is of lesser quality of almost any other tablet in its price range. Unfortunately, it has horrible specs,.and is horribly misrepresented by those who should know better.  DO NOT BUY THIS-- A kindle is not just a kindle, this is their apparent top of the line, and it does NOT do what it says it will do,.  It WILL NOT store your videos, photos, audible selections, or kindle books in the SD card  You are extremely lucky if you can get your kindle books off the internal storage. Horrible misrepresentation. It's like listening to the Trump family hawk one their products. Bezos should be be ashamed of himself!  Horrible. Back to Apple for everything!"

2,Nice upgrade from Fire 7 Tablet seems to freeze up at times. Love the bigger screen.,,,,
3,,,,,"Amazon Interface Restricts Apps While this is an inexpensive tablet, you give up a lot, as the Amazon shell severely limits the apps you can use. Want to use the New York Times app? Sorry, Amazon (Bezos) owns the Washington Post, so no Times app for you. Amazon apparently also doesn't like Google, so no GMAIL app, no YouTube App, no FireFox. But you do get a leggy-slow tablet. It is cheap, but frustrating. I will say as an alternative to Alexa, it is great if you are just going to leave it on your counter and play through bluetooth speakers."

The device needed to be restarted at least once a day to solve these issues.  Then this morning it decided to perform a factory reset for no reason.  I lost everything.  A call to Amazon support was more aggravating than anything as I was told that this function could have only been done from the device ""accidently"".  A Google search revealed that this is not an uncommon problem, that Amazon is aware of it, and STILL the tech insisted that I must have somehow accidently done it myself.  Like many people, the information stored on my tablet is more valuable than the tablet itself.  The summary of the tech support was that there is no problem I can fix.  There is no way to prevent this from happening again.  And there is no way to back-up so that the information could be restored if this repeated itself.  JUNK!",
8,,,,,"Not good for kids I am returning this tablet because you cannot use Google play and the Amazon app store does not have all of the apps that Google play does. There is a way to install Google play however, it blocks many features of the apps. There also isn't a way to remove the 10000 apps that come pre-installed on the device. I got this for my kids and there is no way to move the apps off the home screen or a way to move or remove the search bar. I am going to get a normal android tablet. I feel like Amazon needs to realize that Google play is essential to a good majority of tablet users. Amazon got greedy and covered the entire tablet with Amazon related everything."

6,,,"Would like to know what ""Without Ads"" actually means? Paid extra for the ""without ads"" feature so as not to see ads covering Pinterest items, or popping up on other sites I visit. Doesn't seem to make any difference, still getting them. Other than that I'm enjoying reading again.",,

5,,"Runs perfectly Love it. Very responsive to touch, accessibility is great as usual, seems to run everything promptly",,,
6,,Im a minimalist It works,,,
7,,,,"Junk. How can anyone say these are good? This is a totally useless tablet.  I had it for about 20 minutes and it is back in its packaging waiting to be returned.  The image quality is decent, the touch screen is too sensitive, and the speed is so SLOW that it is unusable.  The amazon overlay is also terrible making it basically  useless for anything but Amazon and Netflix, if it would even be fast enough for movies.  The WiFi radio is substandard as well having only 2 bars of signal approximately 10 feet from my router, while all my other devices have a full signal anywhere on my property, inside or out.  The selection of applications is extremely limited, you can't install Google Maps or Google Earth, and that's when I wiped it and put it back in the box to be returned.  This thing is absolute trash.  Buy a Lenovo if you want a cheap tablet that actually works and let's you install any android app. They're just over half the price of this inferior junk and actually work.",
8,,,Needs improvement Battery life definitely needs improvement. But biggest issue is synching my books to my reader. It’s easier to synch to my iPhone or iPad than it is to the fire tablet which makes no sense. Should be more seamless.,,

3,Product as advertised In place of cell phone,,,,
4,,Do like the Kindle Fire Tablet. Sometimes when I am playing a game the touch screen freezes up. I don't know if it is the tablet or the game. Frustrating.,,,
5,,Faster than the fire 8 Love my new Kindle!  I hope this one lasts longer than the last one I had.  Costs a lot to have to replace every two years.,,,
6,,I have a 10.  It is wonderful but not great to carry.  The 8 fits in my purse. Size and quality.,,,
7,,,,,"Fire OS sucks What is an otherwise awesome tablet, the Fire OS is quite disappointing compared to pure Android. Coming from a very much older Android tablet, the amount of Amazon presence everywhere is rather obtrusive. Wouldn't be so bad if someone could remove or hide the presence of so much unwanted stuff. There are far better web browsers than Silk, but one has to go through much to add Google Play to replace it. This would be an awesome tablet if Amazon would replace the Fire OS with pure Android and then add their ""stuff"" such that this tablet could be easily set up for the user's individual preferences rather than force it's idea of what one ""wants"" in a tablet."
8,,,,"Latest not the greatest...  problems with the new Kindle 8 Plus My wife uses her Kindle 8 almost exclusively for audible books...  which she listens to a lot...  she had been having problems with her previous kindle 8 (last years model) where the audible app would stop working and need the app cache cleared and a restart before it would continue...  so we upgraded to the brand new 8 plus with more storage and memory to hopefully address that problem.  What a mistake....  the audio cuts out several times daily and won't work again until the device reboots...  kindle and audible stop working correctly so it just goes back to home when you try to look at your library in either.  There doesn't seem to be a way to clear app cache either so the only way I've got them working again is a reset to factory and set it all up again... done this 4-5 times in the week or so we have had it.  Head phones plugged into the headphone jack with play/pause buttons don't work half the time now.  I'm a tech guy thats been able to keep it running, my wife would have thrown it away already.",

0,,,,,"Save a little more, buy an ACTUAL tablet This tablet would be alright if it wasn't an Amazon product. I was pretty excited to get a good deal on my first tablet, but this thing is almost useless. It comes with very limited-functioning amazon software, with a little wizardry this can be fixed to run google software (like any other, normal android device), but this is going to cause a slew of other problems. I started to drive off with it on top of my car and smashed the screen 2 weeks after i got it, and im really not mad because as soon as i can afford any other tablet, this is going in a box probably to never be touched again."

4,,,Don't buy if you don't want to have to replace all of your chargers. Don't buy if you don't want to have to replace all of your chargers. They change the charge cord to a USB-C so none of your cords that are mini USB's that you have used for ALL of your other kindles won't work.,,

0,,,,,"No HDMI out and no wireless casting The tablet is fast and a good price.  However, I bought this to replace my old Fire HD tablet which had a micro HDMI output so that I could plug it in to HD tvs to watch videos, show presentations in office documents, etc.  This new tablet does not allow that at all with a cable or wirelessly.  Amazon for some reason shut that capability off.  The technology is there with the USB-C port and could cast it but Amazon shut that down."

9,,Faster with better battery Had the older 2017 version and this one is waaaaayy better and faster. Battery life is better and HD is nice.,,,
0,,,,"As a long time Amazon costomer, this is absolutely terrible. Let me preface this by saying that I typically really like Amazon products and services. I own a couple of Echos (and smart home accessories--lights and plugs and what have you), Kindles, and also subscribe to several amazon services. I bought this tablet from another retailer because they had it on sale. Even at the price I bought it for, it is absolutely terrible. App selection is atrocious, the quality of the screen looks like something out of the year 2009, the performance is sluggish, it feels criminally cheap, the touch screen is not pleasant to use, the user interface is the exact opposite of intuitive, and zero, and I mean ZERO, customization options.I swear, I have no idea how Amazon can produce such a terrible product. They are literally known for experience and ease of use. They are known for intuitive, well thought out products. And they come up with this? How can the company that brought us the Echo, Kindle, and streaming Fire devices come up with such an atrocious product?? Sale or no sale, I'm taking this thing back to the store.",

I kept it for when my niece and nephew come by to visit. I also forgot that the tablet does not let you download apps outside it's eco sysytem. So no fantasy football apps allowed.

It somehow uses up battery life even when not in use...that's just stupid.  Even if I don't use it I'll have to remember to charge it up every few days.  Not the easiest to navigate either.  And the constant pushing at you to have Amazon everything is a bit much.  I'll never recommend one of these type of products.

2,,,,"Garbage I'm really sorry to have to write a bad review. I own 4 fire tablets three 10 inch 1, 8 inch (2012 older) and they are great . This one I bought for books and Audible. It has NO sound you can't even hear it if you hold it right up to your ear . The screen is not clear so its not good for reading or watching anything on it. I paid extra for 8 inch plus but its not any faster. I should have gotten another 10 inch but I wanted the smaller one for reading, podcast, audio books. I should have sent it back but I didn't, but I won't buy anymore either. Ill just go back to using my iPad . even though is huge. And I can't buy my books thru the Kindle app. I do buy all my books with Amazon.",

Never had that problem before.It also doesn't always sync content.I didn't care too much for the previous .keep but to call this a plus, charge extra for the privilege denigrates the meaning of plus. And part of it figured out how to fix on my own. Shame on you, Amazon, for  such a shoddy product AND customer service. You have my home phone. Use it.This was going to be my primary but when the screen came up to choose which device to back up from, the screen does not show all my devices. Several of the choices I haven't had for years. Tried talking to a real person lately?I know there are problems and I don't expect miracles,but shipping a product like this should assume some level of support.And the new screen in content and devices? How do I change the default.Anybody there????",

This is my third Kindle.  When I purchased the second one, all the books I had on the first Kindle downloaded onto Kindle number 2.  Not true with this purchase of Kindle number 3.  Also, when I turn on this new Kindle, it does not automatically go to a home page.  I will probably go back to using my old Kindle for books and use this new one for audio only.  I am VERY unhappy with my purchase."

I hate the new layout, homescreen does not show latest books, videos, etc. have to go to one or the other over and over.  Loses connection with internet easily even though all other devices (in same area) work fine, ie: iPhone, Mac, streaming TV.  I now read books and watch videos on either my phone or laptop.  Waste of money in my opinion.  I don't know what they changed but my first two Kindles worked so much better than this one."

 Amazing tablet very fast, clear images my daughter loves I’m buy another for me too.",,,
2,,,,,"Amazon owns your Fire, and lets you know it Like the Google ecosystem?  Avoid this device.  Amazon is clearly trying to limit competition so, despite it running an Android OS, Google apps are either unavailable (Duo, for example) or super crappy (YouTube .... YouTube, people).  The whole thing is also clearly designed to push products in your face, is much less customizable than most Android OS, and generally makes me feel like I'm using a platform that Amazon owns rather than one that I bought.  And I even paid for the ad-free version.Mechanically it's a so-so device, you get what you pay for.Would definitely not buy again."
3,,Love it I received this as a gift and I love it. Its fast and the battery life is great. I would definitely recommend this one.,,,

The two main issues is after being fully charged on my separately purchased Amazon, Wireless Charging Dock, the unit drops from 100% to 60% in ... you guessed it, 40 minutes. Matter of fact, I can set my watch from it. Also, I have apps I installed / transferred from my old Fire but they do not register my subscriptions. The instructions to add your subscription is cryptic, vague and confusing. Besides that the process doesn't work. Why does Amazon have to make things so difficult for people??!!"

2,,,,"Wish I hadn't bought this I read a whole lot of reviews before deciding to buy. I have 2 older kindles. I got the distinct impression that this is not a kindle, but better than that. IT IS NOT. There are so many shortcomings I don't know where to begin. If I'd known then what I know now, I'd have gone with some other kind of tablet. And bear in mind I do not do a lot of things that practically everyone else does: no big game playing (only solitaire, crossword, etc. that's it) no watching movies, etc. And apparently there's some problem between amz and ggle so if you're used to using ggle as a search engine you'll have to use another device. And bing isn't worth the letters it takes to spell it. If you like crappy tabloid news for your sources of info, then bing's the one for you. Also, word to the wise, pay the extra and not have the overwhelming annoyance of the ads.  After having this thing for a few months I've gone from disappointed to not liking it to hating it.",

7,,Easy to use. This is my third edition of the Kindle Fire. I enjoy it and use it daily.,,,
8,,,,,"Cheap Amazon makes you watch their ads. When I try to watch YouTube there are tons of Amazon ads blocking a third of the screen.  My grandson tries to touch the screen and accidentally orders a product from the ads which I have to cancel.  It’s just cheap to force us to watch the ads and deal with this. I found this out after the return period closed or I would have happily thrown it into the box and kicked it back to Amazon.Cheap, cheap, cheap in treating Prime members this way."
9,,"Great tablet for the price. A nice evolution of the Fire Tablet. If you would use the wireless charging I recommend getting it, otherwise the standard HD8 or the HD10 is probably a better value.",,,

After watching  many videos online, I then bought the 4k fire stick, also with the hope of mirroring the screen still to no avail,  all I can do is screen casting of Amazon content, but not mirroring.

This is the third kindle I’ve purchased so far for my children, and instead of improving from previous generations, this one seemed slower. Delayed touchscreen, long reaction time, WiFi connectivity issues. The list goes on. If you want a cheap tablet that sometimes works for a child, it’s okay. I’m tempted to look at iPads at this point, and just pay more for function and reliability."

I looked online to see if anyone else had had similar issues.  I found a few and there was some suggestions about settings to try changing, etc.  Since this was brand new, I didn't feel like I should have to figure out a ""fix.""

I'm at the point of really wanting to try something else.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
9,,,,,if you want an tablet don't buy its only a reader book I am not really happy with my Fire tablet you can't use it like a regular table 😒like downloading stuff you have to go through the Amazon store which doesn't have alot of apps like android table I thinks it's a good reader book that's all I wish I gotten a tablet instead...and its not touch screen I'm trying to figure it out why I can't touch my screen and make it work as well

4,,,,,"Buyer Beware! Functions well as a ""Kindle Device"" and as a Video Player. It also does well as a game device.  However, advertised as a Media Player, It falls way short.  You can play Music only as long as that music comes from Amazon.  So if you want to play music that you already own (Music that you bought from any source other than Amazon) Too bad.  You can transfer your music from your computer to the music directory on the fire tablet but the Amazon Music App will not play it.  Sending my ""great media device"" back."

Having a single calendar where I can monitor, accept and set meeting requests through various email account is essential to the way I use a tablet.  This function used to work in the former OS on the previous Fire 8"" but the new OS on the Fire HD 8"" Plus tablet just isn't workable."

I turn it off just to go back in immediately to see it's all the way up! I put on do not disturb the volume is all the way up! What the crap is going on!

6,,"Quality Runs great, fast, viewing clarity. Love it",,,
7,,,,Links to websites get redirected to App Store I was told by a representative when I ordered it that it would act like a tablet. Unfortunately if I go to click on the website for my email I get directed right to the App Store and not to a website. I am also having an issue synchronizing the fire with my printer. Even if I wanna watch a video I log into a website and the video plays for maybe three seconds and then goes right back to the App Store. Also when I try to go on the web same thing with some websites so it certainly doesn’t act like a tablet like I was told that it would which is why I gave it such a low rating.  I assumed that the HD eight was an upgrade over the HD seven that I had before. However the HD seven synchronizes much better than the eight. I can also print from my HD seven but I can’t on the HD eight,

6,,,,"Operating system is quirky I have had this kindle for about one year and it is mostly ok. It works well as an e-reader for books, for email and to surf the web. However, the operating system, as modified by Amazon has problems. When the software is updated or the device is restarted I loose all cover art for my books. In the library I show books, browser and apps, occasionally one of this doesn't show and I have to restart the device to get it back. When I look at the books I have loaded on the kindle or in my library occasionally none of my books show up and the filter option doesn't work. Very quirky operating system. If you are looking for a cheap (not inexpensive) tablet then you might consider this product. Otherwise, look at something else to meet your needs.",

4,,,,,"Bought this for school but the app I need for school is not on the Kindle platform. I bought this tablet for reading and my graduate studies. While the application to read my textbooks electronically is compatible, the application I need to view and post my studies is not. The Canvas app, which is a quite common education application, is not available through Amazon. This basically defeats the whole purpose of buying this overpriced eReader, and due to covid my program was on hold since buying it, and now it is too late to return it. Look for this, gently used, Kindle to be up for sale on FB Marketplace or Offer Up."
5,,Great Tablet This is a great tablet. I use it everyday. Great quality for the price!,,,

Every time I tried to sign into the game it would just return me to the log in page. I did many things advised to solve the issue but nothing was successful. After 2 days of futile attempts, even with support help, I decided to return the Kindle Fire 8 Plus. I'm considering returning to the Kindle 7 since I had no issues with that except it was very old and I was hoping to upgrade."

It finally allowed me to load our Kindle library, however, there is another issue.  The volume control for audio books intermittently resets to ZERO volume.  Also, when there is volume control available, the level is too low to hear clearly and the quality of the voice is very tinny or nasal."

7,,,,,"Love everything about the device accept..... I love everything about the functionality of the device(s): long battery life, ease of use,  storage capacity, weight, versatility, integrations with other devices all wonderful attributes. I very much dislike the constant stimulation to try this, buy that, look at this, read that, It gets old fast and actually stops me from using the device(s) as much as I would. The same goes for the echo show. Constant motion and sell. See this? Oh, you like it? Buy it! Enough all ready. Alexa, ""screen off"" is a powerful feature as is the on/off button...."

9,,,,,"Fire OS makes everything harder After using a Fire tablet for several years, I recently switched to a comparable tablet with a standard Android operating system, for a price similar to a Fire. .  I feel liberated!  The Fire OS is so strangled, it makes almost every activity except watching videos and reading books so much more cumbersome. Regular Android email, calendar, browsing, photos, keyboarding, YouTube, app selection, you name it, is seamless and easy.  None of the workarounds or extra steps.  I'll never go back to a Fire."
0,,Get the extra RAM -- makes a huge difference in performance Replaced an older low memory Fire 8 with a 64GB unit -- what an incredible difference?,,,
1,,,,"Not worth investing in I ordered this Kindle after my 13-year-old one died. I am so annoyed with this new Kindle, I’m going to return it. 1) Screen brightness fluctuates erratically, going from the level I have it set at to half that while I’m reading a book or playing a game. 2) After a few minutes of playing a game, the screen locks up, and won’t respond at all. The only option is to turn the device off and restart it. 3) Amazon has programmed this device to interrupt my attempts to open some games by wasting my time and intruding into my personal space by showing multiple ads for juvenile and inane games. Right now, I’m not sure I ever want to see another Kindle. I may change my mind, but this one was a total bust and a waste of money.",
2,,,,,My new fire tablet So far I have not found it useful.  Any game I get on it is PACKED with ads.  And I paid extra to not have ads on the device.  I still have a lot to explore on it but have not had time right now.  It certainly is much better than my really old old Fire.  But everything has to be Amazon related--should have gotten a tablet.  Probably will  be more useful if we ever get to travel again.
3,,,,,"Collections do not transfer Collections not under audiobook. Feel Amazon did a horrible job on this kindle. Should have modeled it on the new paperwhite. Here’s what my paperwhite does that the newest HD 8 does not.Collections and additions in books transfer to audiobooks.Recognizes where I am in a book or audiobook. HD8 always starts at beginning.Volume is wonderful. Can barely hear HD8.Can add books and audiobooks.Can see which audiobooks are downloaded. HD8 has a download section, but most titles are not downloaded.Something is horribly wrong. Unfortunately I returned my old HD8 when I bought this one. Will return when I get home."
4,,Wireless charger great reliable fast kindle. Like wireless charger and speed of unit.,,,
5,,New Kindle Fire is great I upgraded from an older model and absolutely love everything about itThe resolution is amazingSo happy with this purchase!,,,
6,,,,"Lack of Apps and Limited use. The lack of apps, even for products sold by amazon, make this thing junk. I know I can ""jail break"" it to side load the google play store, but that still is no guarantee that the google apps with work on this thing due to the Amazon Proprietary tweaks to the OS.",
7,,,"Eh Wouldn't play Prime video,  was able to watch on my regular 8"" kindle.  I really don't find  much of a difference,  plus always says "" KINDLE running"" in the background , and can't find explanation as of why.",,
8,,,,"Fire tablets need to come of age! I bought this tablet due to its size and listed specifications. I have heretofore been a purely ""android"" user, mainly Samsung products. What a disappointment this product has been! Formatting of external micro SD cards to be compatible with this device is just short of maddening. The lack of compatibility with so many other traditional android devices and apps is appalling. Battery life is okay. Screen resolution is so-so, and the touch screen is probably what you would expect from a relatively cheap device. My other small screen android device, a Samsung 8.4 "" HD device put this fire HD tablet to shame, and it was 5 years older but died from lack of support and a dying battery.  Big disappointment overall. The only positive thing I can say is that I have purchased numerous cheaper Fire 7"" tablets for my grandchildren because of the simplicity of use.",
9,,,,,Not good quietly tablet and amazon applications take too much spaces from screen Not easy to function well as ipad or Samsung tablet from my experience.  The tablet case itself material quietly not strong enough as ipad or Samsung tablet and I didn't return the amazon tablet or exchange because I already purchased the screen protector and case for it so this is my experience afrer I use amazon tablet. You might like amazon tablet but I don't! Thanks for read my review!

However, Alexa is my go-to for timers, reminders, notes, background music, security system, etc. Now, they are taking away features & it isn't even a year old yet! Updates are supposed to improve a device, not restrict it MORE. I'm very disappointed. Without the Dark theme for Alexa app, one of the things they took away, I get migraines every single day from staring at the bright screen. If I turn the brightness down or change it to night mode, I cannot read the print. Sadly, I ""invested"" in the version that doesn't have ads so I got extra burned with the update that removed a necessary feature for my health. The ""customer service"" people just apologize, which doesn't make it better. I just want what I HAD that Amazon decided to take away... I wonder what they will take next! VERY DISAPPOINTING.",

My first Fire tablet worked just fine until Alexa came along. Once I turned her off the thing stopped working. I bought this one and set things up. When next I had time to use it it would not let me in!?! I went to the lock unlock screen on line as there is never a telephone number to call if you are having trouble. It worked once and I tried to reset my pin. Guess what, locked out again.  It sits on the counter and tells time, sometimes the weather. I am using my kindle. It does what i want it to, reads my books and lets me play scrable. And it has a dictionary. I have access to my Bibles.  Sure is a disapointment. Would really like to talk to someone who could tell me how to get it to work.",

It doesn't give you the latest updates, and one the latest updates messed up my kindle by putting a swipe password on it instead the kindle either uses a pin code or a regular password. Even with the SD card that came with it works fine with it, but in general for me I have to call regularly to see if I have any updates and I do that I am not getting on a regular basis. So I rather just go back to Samsung tablet. I dealt with kindles for years and had nothing but problems with them and since I can't afford a new Samsung tablet at this point I am pretty much stuck with this cheapo version. Amazon should just stick with e-readers and everything else not tablets. So I am very disappointed and upset about there tablets and on top of that I think customer service doesn't really care in my mind.",
