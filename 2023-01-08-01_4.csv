The 2020 release is a major upgrade from my old tablet and the overall performance is impressive. The battery life lasts me the entire day and the design is sleek and stylish. I also appreciate the added features such as hands-free Alexa and the option to add additional storage with a microSD card. The price point is unbeatable and I highly recommend the Fire HD 8 tablet to anyone in need of a portable entertainment device.

4,,,Not as good as an android tablet The apps are a little more limited on these than any other android tablet.  Biggest disappointment was not having YouTube kids app. Another disappointment is the amount of ads most of the games have. Even the unlock screen has a add in the background that changes. Tablet itself is good quality. I'll be sticking to android tablets for future purchases as this tablet is the last resort if all other tablets batteries are dead in the house.,,
5,,Good product Great product. Got one for both of my kids. They love it.,,,

0,,,"Full of issues This was a replacement for a the same Kindle Fire that stopped working well. It wouldn't play downloaded videos (in Showtime, HBO Max and Netflix) and stopped connecting to my bluetooth. All I use it for is books and downloaded videos to watch while on the stairclimber at the gym. I don't have other apps or use it for internet or messaging (I have a phone for that) So given it wouldn't play videos and I had to plug in a headset made it pretty much worthless. I was able to get a replacement under warranty. This one is marginally better. I can play downloads but always have to close out whichever app I'm using since even though I'm in downloads it must default to streaming and the videos just go into the eternal load mode. Once I restart the app it lets me play downloads. It's also working with my bluetooth. It would be better if you could wake the screen by touch rather than having to use the side buttons which can be awkward on cardio equipment. It would also be better if the volume button wasn't next to the wake button. I often hit the wrong button and end up closing the screen instead of adjusting the volume which is quite a PITA.",,
1,,,,Tablet Good quality and price,
2,,Calidad del Producto Excelente calidad de producto y a un excelente precio,,,
3,"Not user friendly for reading ebooks Not user friendly for reading ebooks. Swipe to read the next page and numerous pages fly by. Hit the ""back' button to get back on track and I'm exited from the book. Hold the Fire horizontally to read and the text shifts to vertical mode. Turn the Fire vertical and the text shifts to horizontal mode. Also, when traveling, the Fire takes a long time to locate a hotel's WiFi login page. The buttons aren't recessed so a small bump will turn the Fire on and the battery begins to drain. I thought a Fire would be an inexpensive alternative to a Kindle ereader. It's not. I'm returning it.",,,,
4,"Worked for 5 months. Now deceased...JUNK - DO NOT BUY. Worked fine for 5 months, then it just stopped working. Did all the recommended button resets, nothing....dead to the world. Amazon only backs this product for 90 days. JUNK - DO NOT BUY.",,,,

All I did on this tablet is read books. Nothing else no streaming, no social media, no mail, nothing but kindle app to read. After 2 chats with amazon they said they would give me 15% off a new one. Do not want to purchase another one bc this is my 3rd with them and I am in shock with amazon customer service.

Please, someone tell me where.If you type in an email address and don't catch a spelling mistake. It gets saved that way and you can't remove it.",
4,The graphics are extremely slow. The graphics are extremely slow. I got it for my daughter for Christmas and she plays robloks or whatever it's called. And now I have to deal with having to send it back and wait for a replacement because now it's not charging. Anyone with an 8 year old daughter knows how heart broken and how much of a nightmare she's going to be. And I've bought a lot of items from Amazon. Including previous tablets for her and my eldest son.,,,,
5,,"Nice larger tablet Very nice, works perfectly like every other kindle I've had. Indulged in the larger screen for watching videos and it's great!",,,
6,,,,"Perfect for Kids I got this device for a 7 year old. It has a good sized screen and runs most of the games fine. Works great for the main game he plays (Roblox), as well as Minecraft. Although the screen sometimes will have problems with touch, even if it is clean (sometimes taps won't register), and it can sometimes feel very slow. But overall, perfect for kids.",

4,,,,,Good value for your money if it actually works properly Doesn’t link up to anything I have probably my problem. Not sure if I’m going to keep them.
5,,,,,Water in plug in port Won’t charge because it thinks that the charging port has moisture in it.
6,Beware of linking this to your account for easier set up I bought this for my son for Christmas and Amzon had a box to check to link this to my account to make it easier to set it up. I did that because Im not very good with this kind of stuff. Long story short on Christmas day he downloaded and deleted 19 games that are charged to my credit card. Awesome,,,,

0,,,"It’s alright Great battery life. Doesn’t get used much- mostly every night as my son listens to music on it to fall asleep. Will go many, many days without charge. It’s nice that we can connect it with the other Alexa devices in our home though I’m sure we’re not using it to it’s full potential. My son wanted some apps he has on his iPad from school that aren’t available on this tablet. He mainly uses if for to access math websites and some learning apps for multiplication, learning the states, and chess. It’s not very user friendly / intuitive but that’s coming from an apple user. I don’t care for all the pop up advertisements. I’ve also given up on the child account and now we both my default setting.",,

6,,Good value quality product My 4 1/2 grandson loves this easy to use tablet,,,
7,,,,,"Obsolete and wasteful This device used to work just fine. But after only two years of use, this device now has trouble loading its home screen, can't play videos without obscene amounts of AV desync, and when I look to see how much amazon is willing to pay for it back, $25. I'm getting really sick of buying devices that break down without any discernible reason, and the company acting like this is normal. It's not. I have devices from 2011 running WINDOWS VISTA that function better than this garbage."
8,,,"Great Device, Terrible Battery Life I love everything about this product except for the battery life. I read an hour to an hour and a half a day, yet have still needed to charge it every three days or so since I’ve received it.",,
9,"DOES NOT TURN ON AND AMAZON WANTS $ TO REPLACE FOR SAME ITEM My tablet stopped turning on after about 30 days of use. Still well within the return window for full refund or replacement.  But the rep I spoke with says they need to collect an additional $15 from me to replace the defective unit. Despite battery being at 96 percent the unit went black and will not restart. Troubleshooting steps did not help. Plugging the unit in eventually allowed it to start after several attempts, but unit went black within a minute despite battery charge still showing 96 percent.  Only way to turn the unit on is to plug it in, Fiddle several times to attempt to get it on, once it is powered up, unplug. Next time it is turned off, same results - will not start up.",,,,

8,Fooled once again by a poor Amazon product Bought this tables in August and it was okay until today.  The screen was clear and I could read books and magazines on it with no problem. I charged it overnight last night and today it is almost unusable.  I don't what happened but now the screen has a brownish-yellowish tint to it.  It almost looks like a picture from 100 years ago.  It is almost impossible to read anything on it because the black font almost disappears into the color of the screen.  Just another worthless product destined to be tossed into a trash can.,,,,

9,,,"This version of Kindle downloads apps I don't want constantly This is my third Kindle over many years. This model has a nice screen, and great resolution. Two things I do NOT like about this Kindle -- it is way too sensitive in terms of not maintaining an orientation for whatever I am reading on it, like a book or a webpage. The slightest movement of my fingers can skew the screen in the opposite direction.Second issue -- I do not know why but this Kindle insists on downloading games/ apps to itself without any overt action on my part. I keep uninstalling games over and over. Not only it's annoying but I have the sense that there is some payoff for the app developers when their game gets a download, whether or not the consumer wants to actually play it.  What happened to the process where you choose a game, then say ""yes I want the game installed"" ?",,
0,,,Great for children.  Not for serious business. I don’t like that it times out. I think it’s a great device for a child.  Not for serious business though.,,
1,Slow video I bought this for my son so we can video chat with my grand baby.  The video is constantly lagging. It is hard to connect. I guess it depends on what you want to use it for but it has internet connection issues and is slow.,,,,
2,,,,,Cannot Install alot. Short warranty You cannot install many games the memory goes low so you need to buy a memory card. Also the warranty is only 90 days. That is sad considering this is an amazon item.
3,,Nice product for the money Wish the screen was bigger...,,,
4,,"LOVE KINDLE FIRE THIS IS MY FIFTH ONE, THIS IS MY SPARE.  PRICE SO GOOD, COULDN'T RESIST !!!!!",,,
5,,,,"In Short, Helpful But Slow. The device was well made, the battery was long lasting, and the screen was somewhat grease resistant (although my greasy fingers still managed to grease it right up). However, even with these good quality of life improvements over the last couple models, I still can’t get past the fact that it is really slow. The hardware just can’t support the software well enough for a good device. It lags even when just scrolling the home screen. I cannot rate it too low however, because it works like it was advertised, and for what it is intended. If you just want an alexa, or a digital book, then this is a great choice.",
6,,"Great improvement I had a Kindle fire 8 that I bought about 5 years ago, I absolutely loved it for several reasons. Imagine the heart break when I dropped it without having it in its case. Yeah, it didn’t end well. Thankfully much of my info was stored on an SD Card.Seeing my sadness, my wife ordered this new Fire 8 for me which appears to include many new features to my old one. It is a much better device than before. It actually makes me happy I dropped my old one",,,
7,,,"Just over a year old and my Kindle won't charge. I paid over a hundred dollars for this Kindle a little over a year ago. Now it's not charging. The support on the device ended. I had my other Kindle for seven years without issue and paid a third of what I spent on this one. Has the device been great? Yes, I read almost every day. However, in the past month it has started to not charge right. I used another cord with no luck. I tried both cords on another Kindle I have and that Kindle charges just fine. It's the device. I won't buy another expensive Kindle again-- spending over $100 for it to not work in a year. I'm not happy that it isn't working just after the warranty goes out and there's no support left for me on the device. Even my Nook, which I've had since they first made them over a dozen years ago or more still works!! It's ridiculous!!",,

Being a Prime member I use to get my orders in 2 days time, abenifit of being a prime member, however recently my orders are taking a week or more to be delivered,so now I wonder if it pays to pay for prime membership, I don't watch shows on Prime very much if at all,so whay am I paying for prime membership???While serfing the web if I see a photo of a a hat or something made of leather that is interesting, Idownload the photo so I can use it as a reference, I have tried to save the photos to the micro sd cardso I can removed the card and print out a copy on my computer, the problem is, you can't do that with aKindel, the images are on the kindel not the sd card, and if you purchase a book from Amazon throughthe good reads app, you can't save it to the sd card either. The kindel is a sales tool, with Amazon rulesand restrictions. Plus you don't get to buy one and that is it, we had to upgrade our Kindels because theAmazon app stopped working after 6 years. Think about that before you buy or is that rent a Kindel?",,

I also don't have a TV at the moment to just put something on in the background, which is what I would normally do to watch TV. So this was my solution... An inexpensive tablet to install all my streaming subscriptions on and have a smaller screen that is JUST for shows while I do other things. It's slow-ish, but it gets the job done.For an added bonus, my youngest cat has learned that this screen responds to touch (unlike my laptop - deliberately not a touchscreen due to cat paws) and I've installed a couple of cat apps on the tablet so that if don't have a show on she can play with it. It's mostly a win all the way around.",

I'm not raging because thankfully I have the other 2 so it doesn't interrupt my reading.Issues:• Slow response, it takes very long for the screen to come up after turning it on.• It takes very long after unlocking for the app menu to come up.• It doesn't always respond when I tap on a book. I only use this device for audiobooks.• It takes very long to download books.• Crackling sounding speaker.• Low volume on speaker.I do not recommend this device, spend a bit more and get a better one.",,

8,Don’t buy this They will update the apps you can’t remove until all the storage space is used and then you won’t be able to use it anymore. It might as well be a scam item. Don’t buy it you like using the things you buy.,,,,

1,"Horrible Story I have had multiple problems with this item from a poor product to horrible customer service.  I returned the first 8-inch fire tablet, because it kept turning off and not turning on unless I came back to the house, plugged it in and restarted it.  They said they fixed it and returned it.  It still kept turning off.  I talked to customer service again.  They said they would send me a brand new fire tablet.  I received a refurbished fire tablet that had the same problem.  I talked to customer service AGAIN.  They said they could not do anything, because I bought it from a vendor and not Amazon.  After asking to talk to a manager and she stated the same thing.  I had to walk them through their own system to prove that I bought it from Amazon digital.  After 3 months of this problem, they wanted to send me another!  I said no and finally got them to send me a return label and credit my account FOR LESS THEN I PAID FOR IT.  I sent the device back that day with their label, and I received an email stating they did not receive it by the date they THOUGHT it should have made it back to them and CHARGED ME AGAIN!  OMG, I cannot believe what poor customer service Amazon has on their OWN products and return policy!  BTW, she said it was a new product and could be having problems - um, two with same problem to one person.  There is problems!  Now I have to deal with these people again.",,,,

0,,"Purchased as an e-reader and watching Prime Video This Fire Tablet is ad supported so you must watch a short ad on the locked screen before being able to access the home screen.  I understand the need for ad support which brings it down to an affordable price point, but if the screen goes off from non-use, you need to rewatch an ad to get back to what you're doing.This arrived already linked to my account which made set up much more easier.  And the speed of switching apps is good.  I did buy a third party screen protector and case.I purchased this to specifically use as an e-reader for my Kindle library and to watch Prime Video.  Both purposes are served well.  The e-reader is easy to read in any type of lighting situation.  The Prime Video works well.  I've also downloaded other apps to mirror what I watch on my Fire Stick.  This makes the device extremely useful during power outages.Good light weight and battery usage is awesome.  Much better than my iPad.  I don't use for gaming so I cannot comment on gaming speed.For the price point(I did buy on an excellent sale) and features, this is a perfect budget tablet.",,,
1,,"Must-have, I use this every day and love it. I had a 2017 Kindle Fire that wore out, and this seemed a suitable replacement.  The review is written on a comparative level with what I'm used to with that older model.  This is a larger, sturdy Kindle Kire that feels substantial.  At first the additional weight was a bit annoying as I typically read in bed, but I got used to it pretty quickly.The screen resolution is incredible - I chose a Van Gogh painting as my background, and you can see the brushstrokes in it.  As I'm old enough to remember when video games were moving pixels, this is stunning to me.  It also upgraded the visuals on a few games that I play on it, in every good way.I don't use the camera so I can't comment on that.  The volume and power buttons are right next to each other - I dislike this as I often tap the volume when I mean to hit the power.  I prefer the older version where they're separate from each other.The charging cord is a type C, which is a sturdier upgrade from the previous micro USB.  It clicks in easily and charges nicely, complete with telling expected time to full charge.  The battery life is impressive, and will also estimate when the battery will run out given current usage.The screen is responsive to touch, with or without the screen protector on it.  The three main screens all have good features - I like that things can be hidden from the menu screen so it's not overly cluttered.Alexa is included, and can be turned off.The Kindle Reading Insights feature has challenges to help encourage reading more. It tracks days, weeks, months, and number of books read and offers achievements for meeting goals.  You can add a reading goal of books per year.  This didn't seem to be working consistently for previous books read, so I'm more conscientious about ensuring books are marked as read now.  It did import activity from my previous Kindle.I love this device and really enjoy the upgrade from my previous, hard working unit.",,,

By week 3 it was barely working and freezing constantly while getting stuck on a black screen.Spent hours on the phone trying to set up an exchange, was told I'd be shipped a new one once the old one was confirmed broken. Went through a nearly 2 hour round trip to dump it off at the return station. 5 days later they send me a used one with missing parts as the exchanged item. I bought this new and expected a new one, not someone else's broken and refurbished one. Now I had to spend a other hour trying to get them to take their garbage back and give me a full refund which the guy on the phone is refusing to do and is instead trying to only give a partial refund.Buyer beware, Amazon products are junk and their return system is even worse.",,,,

8,,,,,"Makes for a decent Kindle, maybe. I had been an iPad user for two generations of the darn thing until Apple priced themselves out of my budget.  After deciding to give the Fire 8 a try, an acquaintance recommended the end-around reprogramming to fool the tablet into thinking it was a regular Android tablet. Before too long, I was experiencing so many odd errors that I undid the conversion.  Now, back in the Amazon universe, I can see why my friend made the recommendation.  Locked inside the Amazon bubble, it's like 1984.  I can see the internet, but I can't go there.  Most annoying is this scenario:  I subscribe to Fubo TV.  So, it would be nice to access my DVR while traveling.  I can get on the internet and navigate to Fubo.tv, but the moment I connect, Fubo pops up their app redirect.  Fire doesn't support the app and I can't get past the pop-up.  My second beef... You want to listen to music?  You'll be hounded to upgrade to a paid version of Amazon Music.  I picked a ""highly rated"" but unfamiliar media player from the app store but quickly discovered that, while it works fairly well, it has no ""close"" button.  Try as I might to navigate out of the player ended with utter frustration.  Now I just restart the tablet.  So, while it operates perfectly as a reader, I already have a Kindle and didn't want another one."

0,,,"Not really what I was hoping for but works Tablets with built in ads removable through paying a ""fee"" for that removal is ridiculous these days. Everything has ads any more. You can't get away from them, regardless if you're watching a news clip, or a video of your own kids playing in the back yard. Overkilling on customers buying your products is a terrible idea, business model or not. Back in the day, people would give away free trials on their products, and you didn't have to go through this sort of garbage in advertisements. Shame on you.The only given plus to this tablet, is you can install the Google app, and the play store by means of hacks that other people have figured out. From there, it actually makes the tablet a worthwhile investment and a cheap alternative to an unlocked android tablet.",,

There's a spot in settings that's supposed to reduce it to an icon, but nope, it's still there hogging the screen.  If I'd known about the push ads, I would have stuck with a Galaxy Tab A."

2,,,,"Faster than the 2022 7"" in many ways!? Purchased for $45 on sale and am not disappointed. Would like to see a Fire OS 8 upgrade -- I think it would handle it just fine.This is the second of 3 Amazon Fire tablets purchased in a matter of mere weeks. I picked up the 7"" 2022 version for use at work just before this one but dropped it and smashed the screen. If it says anything about their price point and usability, I replaced the first with another 7"" on my lunch break at Best Buy.It's true that the cameras are not the greatest but I doubt anyone's picking these up for video chat. I know that it says it in the product description and I will repeat it here:  THIS DOES NOT HAVE THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE (which also means no official YouTube app), so please keep this in mind when making your purchase. At your own risk and the possibility of harming your device, there are options for obtaining the play store or downloading apps not available through the Amazon App Store.I sometimes have touch screen issues when tapping near the Navigation Bar and I find myself accidentally hitting the Device Dashboard on multiple occasions, but other than that it has been quite responsive.The screen is quite bright and despite my dislike of their Adaptive Display feature, some may find this helpful. Because it's very bright, when not in Low Power Mode I make sure to keep it in Night Mode.Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this tablet and can't complain. The price paid for the included hardware make this a handy tablet to have around. Strong WiFi antenna and great speeds. However, some may find that this is a better option for their kids than themselves and I would highly recommend it for that use as well.I'll stick to my 7"" at work and my 8"" for movement around the house, but for the heavier tasks and higher-end gaming.... I have other devices.",

Also, I've found I can't load the local library app, which is stupid for a digital book to not allow a library app, but I guess it forces you to buy Kindle books. I have a cumbersome work around, but it's a pain in the tail when the unit could be a little more robust. I would not recommend.",
6,,,No APPS Available So I have found out since receiving the item that your most basic apps are not available. There is also no eta one when they might have them. I plan to return them if I wanted an old tablet I would have spent alot less . Actually I would never have ordered it and wasted my time had I known!!!!,,
7,,Tablet is great! I like everything about tablet,,,
8,"Pathetic This wouldn’t have passed as competent 10 years ago. It’s cheap and it feels like it. The screen is barely bigger than your phone. The button placement is very awkward and causes you to accidentally lock the screen frequently. The screen is unresponsive and video appears extremely compressed so it doesn’t even appear as the marketed 720p. More like 480p. It’s awkward to hold, particularly if you’re laying down. And the whole thing is extremely slow, you can tell it barely has any processing power. Save up a bit longer and just get a used tablet. This is worse than nothing",,,,

We have used these for our kids for the past 7 years (we’ve gone through three kindles in that time frame).That being said, the Freetime app (has children’s profiles and their content) could use a little tweaking. It has a great selection of stuff for kids (apps/games, books, videos, etc) but you can’t prevent kids from downloading apps. They will fill up the memory in no time and it’s not easy to delete what they download. The easiest thing I have found is to factory reset the kindle when it gets full.",,,

4,,,,,"2020 not the same size as earlier models. My old Fire 8 has a failing battery.  It doesn't hold a charge for more than a few hours...overnight drains it.I ordered this newer model thinking I could use one of the covers I already have rather than spending another $23 for a new one. I'm a victim of planned obsolescence.  This model is a little over half a centimeter wider so the old cover doesn't close.  It is also over a centimeter shorter, so it slides down in the old cover. It doesn't turn on when the cover is opened like the older model, so I have to reach into the cover and the ""on"" button is difficult to find.  I sometimes have to click it several times before it gets the ""on"" message.  I find just holding the unit without a cover, awkward and it tends to slip out of my arthritic hand.Also I want the protection the cover gives it.Another change is the charging cord.  It doesn't fit the old model and the old model's cord doesn't fit this unit. Not a big deal unless you have more than one unit to charge and don't want the extra plug dedicated to charging.It makes a little musical noise when it has been TURNED OFF for hours.  It sounds like someone is accessing it....annoying and worrysome.Another thing I don't like about this model is it doesn't sync with the other Fire 8.  It keeps it's own bookmark, but doesn't recognize I read on another unit while this one was charging.  The older model had this convenience.After trying to get used to this model I've lowered my rating by one star."

I'm sure there's some security issues using the browser all the time as well.

After charging 12 hours it still won't charge 100%. And then there battery drains quickly (4% in 20 minutes). We've only had it about a year. We somehow were able to install YouTube Kids when we first got it, but today it wouldn't let us log in. I decided to uninstall/ reinstall, only to find out the app is unavailable on Fire.

0,,,"Ergonomically awkward While this FireHD tablet is a decent, budget-friendly tablet, it does have some awkward ergonomic details.  Power button - is located on the short edge, right next to the usb-c charging port and is used to turn on and off the display and to reboot/start/turn off the tablet.  What is weird for me is that there is no other way to turn on the screen.  Unlike some tablets that turn on by tapping on the screen, this Fire HD does not appear to have that capability.  Volume Control - Alike the power button, this is also mounted on the narrow edge on the same side as the power button and charge port making that edge a bit crowded. With all the controls and charge port on one edge, the tablet is especially awkward to use when the usb cord is plugged in. Further, I find the texture of the tablet to be quite slippery and prone to slip out if my hand while holding/operating it.  I will surely consider purchasing a folio case so I won't need to handle the less-than-sure-to-hold tablet.On the good side, the screen is crisp and clear, and respond well to touch, and the dual speakers reproduce sound well, yet lack a little in terms of maximum volume.  Still the Bluetooth pairing is fast and works well. Response from the quad core cpu is reasonably fast and there us greater than 21Gb of free space for storage, plus a microsd slot for expansion.I rate this overall a better than average tablet for it's price, but still wish a double tap would bring it to life like my phone and old tablet.",,

It was a fantastic deal, and it even came with a coupon for a free case.  My 7 still works, but it was getting old, and its battery life was a little less than optimal.This Fire 8 is a very nice upgrade.  Although only 1 inch bigger, it makes the view just right.

9,,,,"🙄No longer supports the Amazon App...Huh?😑😑😑 Picked up several of these on sale to replace our much older outdated 7"" tablets that could no longer support the Amazon Shopping app due to insufficient space... Was disappointed to learn that new right out of the box these also upon first boot and setup advised that the Amazon Shopping App was also UNSUPPORTED...and these were supposedly 2020 models!  WTH??What has become of the Amazon Shopping App larely that it has become so bloated or hardware intensive that it can no longer be supported by its own brand spanking new devices??  Uh Houston we gotta problem...Got these mainly for facility of ease & security while ordering from Amazon and upon setup AM TOLD that I cannot use the Amazon App taking up space on my device's home screen BUT must instead utilize a web browser to place and check on orders, which by the way requires me to constantly reenter my Amazon password via a web browser each and every time...something I was entirely trying to avoid.This seems utterly ridiculous when it is primarily FOR this very purpose that these devices were and ARE created...to facilitate ease of greater partaking IN & OF Amazon's ecosystem.  Don't get me wrong...the quality of the build of these devices are great, which is why I still gave it 4 stars...just be aware that if you are primarily getting one of these newer devices to upgrade an older one...Caveat Emptor buyer beware that the Amazon App will STILL be unsupported right out of the box on these 2020 models...something that customers should be foretold of upfront...Don't know who's running things over there these days but its not good and it doesn't exactly inspire confidence in a company that once took pride in both its products & its service.  BOTH have been on the decline as of late...can't tell you how many times I received something shipped in a padded envelope that before Amazon woulda shipped it in a box, or an item shipped in a box with absolutely NO packing material to prevent said item from getting banged around in transit.  When ordering gifts for others I now have to wonder if its WORTH the RISK of it arriving damaged or looking too shabby to give to someone VS hunting for and purchasing said item from somewhere else.And don't get me started about OTHER Amazon devices like fire tv streaming sticks that upon initial setup are now ALMOST FILLED to capacity with bloatware that I simply DO NOT need and won't EVER use and which unfortunately cannot be removed, such as laughingly the Amazon Shopping App (uh that's what I purchased this new Amazon tablet for & strangely cannot use...), Alexa Shopping (kinda redundant), AmazonKIds, Amazon Free Time, Amazon Music (uh that's what I use my Amazon Echo device for...why would I wanna listen to music through my TV (ahem, our HDTV to this day has ghosted image burn from trying to DO exactly that using the Spotify app before getting a dedicated Echo device for said purpose...), Amazon Photos,  Game Circle, Freevee, and on older devices IMdbTV all of which are uninstallable taking up more than half of the devices storage space...slogging down the device and practically rendering it useless in a relatively short time unless you constantly delete the cache of each and every one of these apps which build up whether you use them or not.  Just do a Google query regarding the dreaded INSUFFICIENT SPACE warning regarding these devices and you'll see what I mean...the only remedy being that one must do a factory RESET on said device and go through the whole tedious set-up process at which time during the mandatory update ALL the uninstallable bloatware that caused the problem in the first place is promptly re-installed to your device!So that's my rant for the day regarding these lovely Amazon devices that we have come to USE, LOVE, & ENJOY!...and some of us RELY on a little too much. 👌",

The launch screen is covered with short cuts to app I will never use and can not be deleated. I had to dump them all into a folder and drag it to the bottom of the screen where they would be out of the way at least. Also, you cannot install apps from the App Store, only apps from the Amazon app store and they are mostly unusable like the pre-installed apps. If you are some what tech savy you can get on the internet to learn how to modify the unit, enabling it to download and install apps from the android App Store. You can modify the launch screen too if you have a desktop or laptop computer. It's much more complicated, by design I imagine. That said, you know when you buy the thing you are buying into a whole lot of ads (recomendations). All in all, the Fire functions quite well other than the GUI.

It at least gives me more of excuse to watch more of amazon prime video.I’m mainly using this fire tablet to watch movies or tv. Sometimes I’ll probably use this to read kindle books too. I’m going to experiment and see if I can use writing apps with a bluetooth keyboard. I was heavily disappointed with the youtube app though; unfortunately, it didn’t work, which was lame.Overall, decent deal for this tablet, just some drawbacks",,
4,,Love I really love this product easy to use,,,
5,,,"Battery life is not a plus! If  you like to read &/or research, this product is not for you.  It works well for games.  Ads that completely cover the screen pop up incessantly & are HORRIBLE!  The battery life is mediocre.",,
6,,,,Nice tablet for daily use Screen quality is good.,
7,,"Like it Great tablet, good screen and features.  Only complaint is FireOS 8 wont be coming but the app store is complete, great selection and you get security updates until 2025.  Good job Amazon.  I also highly recommend the 10 inch version",,,
8,,"Great quality for a low price! This is an amazing tablet for a relatively low price- especially compared to the last tablet I had bought! The battery life is insane and even when playing large games that would absolutely drain the battery of my phone in an hour or less, the tablet will still last for hours at a time. The touchscreen responsiveness is great and the device itself is surprisingly sturdy as well. The OS took me a little bit to understand but overall, it's fairly instructional even on its own and it didn't take me long to adapt.TL;DR: good quality, low price, great battery life, can even use to read outdoors",,,
9,,It's light so you can carry it with you anywhere without your hands getting  tired. Personal use.  I love the size and it's not heavy.  I carry it everywhere I go.  I love it!,,,

5,,,Miss the old kindle This one seems more difficult to use.,,
6,,,,Good tablet. This is a smaller tablet. It's just what I wanted and needed.,
7,,,It is good for the price lots of features for what it is. Not able to get google play or samsung play app. The games are very limited.It's a good family use table for media .Some streaming and education apps would be nice addition.  Over all a good tablet the Alexa feature is good when linked to other home devices.,,

1,,Easy to use I use this for everything,,,
2,,,,Charging The charging ports need to be sturdy or better quality,
3,,,,Decent tablet to replace an older one that just quit downloading books. Price was great! I only use it to read mostly Kindle books. Battery life is better than expected. Battery last about 12 hours of reading.,
4,,Love it! This is my first tablet and I absolutely love it. I have read so many books since getting it. I would recommend it to anyone.,,,
5,Buy an IPad Purchased in April/May. October device won’t charge. Purchased for my then 5 year old. Purchased an extended warranty and it’s like pulling teeth with oil covered surgical gloves to get a replacement. Don’t waste your time or money.,,,,

0,,,"Screen quality! I appreciate that it is cheap and pretty good for basic using. However, I wish the screen has higher density. 189 ppi is below the normal standard and makes the eyes uncomfortable.",,

3,,Easy Set Up I was able to set up the device quickly.,,,
4,,Long battery life I love everything about this tablet. It does all that I want it to do. Battery literally lasts for days and I mostly play games on it.,,,
5,,,"It is proving difficult to use. All I really want to do is purchase and download MP3s when I am somewhere with Wi Fi so I can play it without internet access.  I find it is frustrating to figure out and the last time I wanted to download what I purchased, it wouldn't let me do it unless I join Amazon music unlimited.  It is free for 30 days but I shouldn't have to pay to join if I want to download music I already paid money for.  I was also maybe going to use it so I don't have to be on a public computers but a computer is much easier so I guess I'll get some music and that's it . . . Luckily I didn't pay too much.",,
6,,"Good tablet for the basics Bought for my husband to monitor cameras outside, Easy to use, good for the cost",,,
7,,,,"Good quality picture for such a small screen. I like the picture quality ,however I had issues trying to transfer all my old apps & info to the new tablet so my old & new one could share info and apps. Im actually still trying to figure out why it keeps telling me a new person logged onto my account whenever it me...I've tried everything I can think of but still it tells me this whenever I use my new one.sooo,I guess its great for some things like watching movies or reading, but not great for transferring stuff in my opinion.hope this helps.✌",
8,,,,"Keeps phone safe. I like the fact that I can use it for crossword puzzles, solitaire and other uses instead of using my cell phone.I will use it for other things that could free up my cell phone. It seems to be a handy item to have. I can recommend it for anyone that is interested in it.",
9,I’ve never hated a tablet more I got this thinking it would be like my sons other tablet being that he had the 7. If your child wants to download anything you have to approve EVERYTHING. and they can’t even use the Alexa from the child profile. Also if I want to remove the PIN code from my own profile I must delete the child profile first?! Wtf. Seems my choice if my child gets into my stuff. Just so many odd things that don’t make sense. Why why why is it so complicated. So unnecessary,,,,
0,,i got scammed and was caused great stress i am still not ableto use this i called what i thought was amazon to help me and was scammed the asian who i talked to referred me to a peacock no  this was a scan wanting me to get a gift card im not happy  if i cant get this to work orget help from amazon ill be sending it back and im not paying return shipping,,,

3,,ABSOLUTELY PERFECT I love the screen size. All the new and improve features. I use this for all my reading and online needs. Better than my older Kindle Fire but with everything still familiar.,,,
4,,,"No access to Android apps. I can't really give this a fair evaluation since I found out on the first day that you can't DL Android apps.  I looked on line to see if there is a way around it, the work arounds that were suggested (there were more than one) were very difficult to follow.  I couldn't get it to allow downloading Android apps.  The tablet itself is a great deal for $45.00, it just didn't work for me.",,
5,,Must like them I’ve purchased 4 units…says I must like them,,,
6,,,Not as speedy like it showed on HVC A little disappointed.  Not like it showed on QVC.  Wish a manual was included so I can see all its capable of doing.  Still don't know how to use the camera and how to download extra to get the camera to work.  Ugh!,,

8,,no It is easy to operate.,,,
9,,,,"Excellent for the price. Convenient smaller tablet. Does everything I wanted. For under $70 I have email, Facebook, Netflix among many other options.I use it mainly while traveling because the screen is bigger than my iPhone. I’m impressed.",
0,,,,"Good for Basic Web Use I bought this for use when I travel, instead of lugging my 15.6"" laptop, and worrying about security.  It fills the need for web browsing, reading emails, listening to music and watching videos.  But, I I wish there was a larger selection of apps.  It would be great if regular Android or Linux Apps could be used.  Could not install my Firefox browser with its sync capabilities.",
1,,I love these fires This is my fifth fire. I have given a few away but couldn't pass up the price on this one.,,,
2,,Bueno Buena,,,
3,,,,Easy to set up and start using. Fun easy to understand set up. Wish it had a rough texture it is kinda slippery! Quailty of screen very good.,
4,It was free from a friend. I would never make this purchase. Not for me,,,,
5,,,,GOOD FOR AIRPLANE RIDES AND TRAVEL Ordered this for a Spirit flight to Jamaica - good battery life and okay screen resolution - no 4K,
6,,,Buy cheap get cheap! This device is limited in games I figured I would be able to get the same games in have on my iphone on this device nope. This device is limited in wifi capacity barely makes any connections and when it does takes long time to loading anything from YouTube to Amazon videos.,,
7,,Great value! Does everything. Small but powerful.,,,
8,,,,,"Not impressed at all Proved operating system incredibly slow,  the camera and volume up/down & power keys are oddly and pretty inconveniently placed, the amazon appstore had very little available for download.Ask in all I'm power unsatisfied with it all together."
9,,Perfect Does everything I was looking for love it,,,
0,,,product is unsatisfactory I cannot get a clear sharp picture.  I purchased this product to play games.,,
1,,"Love this Fire HD 8 tablet I wasn't really looking for a new Kindle for though my old still works great not like it used and also storage space was becoming a problem for it has not memory card slot like my new one and decided to check out the Kindles more out of curiosity not with the intent of buying one. So, I checked them out but also did homework the pros and cons like I do for many things I have checked into. The HD 10 Kindle was too big, and I really loved the look and style of the Kindle HD 8 especially the one I ended up getting and I love it very much. The screen works great very clear and bright. I also like that it has a memory card slot.",,,
2,,Great item for the price ,,,
3,,screen quality I use product for personal enjoyment and pastime pleasure,,,
4,,Wonderful 8inch tablet with a great Price and VALUE Small enough to take in any purse. Long battery life and great value! Easy use and holds so many apps.  I LOVE this one.,,,
5,,,Not what I thought I purchased this tablet for my son but am unable to download apps for him to play with,,
6,,Like it We got this as a gift for our daughter and she loves it! So far so good with the tablet!,,,
7,,"The best of the lineup I have the new 7” 2022 fire, the 10” 2021 fire plus, and this 8” 2020 version of the fire lineup. I am a huge fan of the Amazon eco system especially when it comes to the delivery service and their ebook world. I think this is the best thing that has come to happen in technology. I love that these tablets are budget friendly, updated frequently and still can access the google play store. I’m hoping the newer versions remain that way though…This 2020 8” fire tablet is by far the best one. The 7” has no access to google play and it is a tad slower than this version. The 2021 10” plus I have surprisingly doesn’t function as well as this one. I can’t browse through Amazon, while watching a video without the video pausing or turning off.  For some reason this fire tablet can continue to multitask way better than the one with higher RAM.I actually had this version in a plum color back in 2020 but I gave it away. But I really wanted a 8 inch again and I chose this over the new one just in case I wouldn’t have access to google play… and I truly love the white aesthetic. I tend to grab this size over any other. I love to read books and find this to be a comfy size for me.",,,
8,,,,"Kinda slow The screen is clear, battery lasts for at least a day  and it’s nice you can have multiple profiles but it’s slow. Bought for my 7 year old son and he can play games offline in the car. Feels like it takes forever for videos to load online whether using Wi-Fi at home, a mobile hotspot or at grandparent’s homes.",
9,,Fire - for music Unable to pair headphones to this unit.,,,
0,,Really can't complain since it's so inexpensive Cheap tablet for the kids. Great device to consume data. Like all the streaming services.,,,
1,,works great it was exactly what I needed.  My old one was out of date,,,
2,,,"Will NOT do email I like most of the features and qualities of this Kindle. When I selected, then tried to email a section of text to myself, It was impossible to create an email account, and there was simply NO email inbox anywhere on the device. Clearly, after an hour or more spent trying to make it work, the only way to do that would require me to contact Amazon. Not good.",,
3,Good... IF it turns on It's unpredictable. I expect it to turn on when trying to turn it on. It's brand new. Battery is 90% charged or better. But 2 out of 3 uses require it to be plugged in in order for the button to turn it on. Basically it's junk.,,,,
4,,The wife loves it! The wife loves it!,,,
5,,Good Screen goes dull too quickly,,,
6,,,"Amazon shopping app not supported in Fire 8 (10the gen) So disappointed. Really used my Kindle Fire HD 8 as a shopping, reading, movie-viewing tool when out of the house/office. Generally satisfied with the previous three. But now the shopping app doesn't work in gen 6 or my newest gen 10. Called support. Jumped thru their hoops, but they couldn't make them work either. Two of three Fires are useless to me. Don't trust the security of the Silk browser, so I guess my Amazon shopping will be limited to home laptop. Debating returning my newest Kindle Fire. Certainly won't be buying any in the future without a functioning app.",,
7,,"Very Good value and function Very clean, battery life excellent. Gen 7 supports current Sw/Apps Big upgrade from wife's old 2016 ipad at very reasonable price.",,,

1,,"I LOVE IT I'm not a techie, so computers etc., are a challenge to me sometimes.  But I love what I've been able to do with this tablet.  Only issue was the website for the free case w/personal picture at Caseables.  Had to get customer support to get me to the right website not disclosed with voucher.  Finally got it resolved, hopefully it looks the way I want it do...wish me luck.",,,
2,,Impressive for $45! Got this on Prime Day deal for $45. Outstanding!,,,

0,,Good battery Harder to set up than advertised,,,
1,,"Fast, easy to read and clear detailed images Good size clear screenFast speedeasy to use",,,
2,,"Works great for reading! Price for 2020 Kindle is great.  Prepackaged Online support is good for blurps at the beginning.  My screen froze, but simple off/on instructions saved the day.  Much much better than my 2019 kindle, for which I got $20 trade-in.  Reading is better, 8"" screen seems much bigger, enough for a good read.  Quality of print is fine, no adjustments needed.  Battery life of 12 hours is a big plus.  Overall, after a week, I am a fan!!!",,,
3,,Must have for books! Got this for my 14 yo who does school at home and all the books he’s required to read. Thought this would be perfect instead of trying to get to the library. Books are here in a click of a button. Plus we got this on the prime sale and got a great day!,,,
4,,- -,,,
5,I’m baffled by the positive reviews. The user experience on this dumb marketing-garbage-delivery-platform is awful. Fleeing back to the iPad. Can’t believe people like these. You definitely get what you pay for.,,,,
6,make our product less disability friendly Amazon Kindle use to be the only product I could use to read because it had voice to text so it would read the story with me. But who cares about that defiantly not Amazon. Because they care about their money only. Now I don't get to read books unless I pay for audibly which only does books not email or papers. Or I turn setting to me being blind which adds 70 steps. I don't need. Way to not improve your product Amazon.,,,,
7,,"Amazing for the price! Super easy to use I love this tablet! Light weight, big screen, easy to use.",,,
8,"Not worth it. Spend your money on a Samsung or iPad. Super slow, cheap feeling, terrible experience just even setting it up. My kids prefer an iPad over this.",,,,
9,,,,,Amazon apps only Amazon apps only no play store
0,,Great for traveling. Compact and great for traveling.,,,
1,,,,,"Great for Turtles! I purchased this so that I could sit in my recliner and have a small device instead of a large 12 in iPad or laptop. The size is ideal, I really enjoy that. However, it is slowwwwwwww as molasses in the winter, it has a delayed response, and it ruins my game playing! It won't allow one to install any Google apps (which is what I've been using for decades!), it's difficult to use multi-page browser use, and navigating to and from anything is difficult. I got this for only $50; it was $49 too high!"
2,,Surprised at the color and clarity Liked the color and clarity and battery life.,,,
3,,,It’s fine. It’s day four of having the tablet and already it’s glitching and won’t turn on even though fully charged. The battery life drains very quickly. I guess you get what you pay for.,,
4,,good buy! The kindle fire is perfect for my disabled grandson. He can choose what he wants to watch and take with him wherever he goes.,,,
5,,,,"It can do more than you think The tablet is kind of limited with just the Amazon app store. But if you search for ""add play store to Fire HD 8 tablet"" it will show how you can get the Play Store and have access to thousands of apps.",
6,"Constant sound issues across all apps and slow -My expectations were realistic for the price. But the volume of the sound on any app I’ve used will go up and down randomly. It’s fine with headphones, not the internal speaker.-Basic apps like Silk Browser are laggy and choppy.-The overnight delivery was in fact 2 days, not even next day. Small, but disappointing.The screen quality is good. The interface is fine. The external quality feels good. But the other issues make me not want to even use it and I was excited.",,,,
7,,Tablet is everything they advertised. Great battery life,,,
8,,Love it My great grandson loves it and the battery life is awesome,,,
9,,,,,Not what I expected wanted to download some of my apps wasn't compatible with them!! It would say the fire tablet was not the latest version so I couldn't download some of my apps so I sent it back to QVC I wasn't satisfied with it!!

1,,Quality at a low price!! We bought the tablet for Oscar which is a parakeet he was on my phone all day I needed to get him something of his own. He absolutely loves it the screen time issue to three hours daily,,,

5,Print soooo small Hate it!,,,,
6,,Great for reading Using primarily for downloads from my library. Lettering crisp. Worth every penny.,,,
7,Defective.  Locks up. Tablet was not able to function more than a few minutes.,,,,
8,,much better than the older fires I find the new fire clearer and more comfortable to use.,,,
9,"Piece of junk Biggest waste of money. I bought this as a secondary tablet at home. This ""tablet"" is nothing more than a glorified kindle. I don't understand why Amazon won't simply make a true Android based tablet. I could've spent a couple bucks more on an off brand Android tablet and had a better experience.  For those of us in a budget we should be able to buy a good quality tablet without spending a fortune. This is not it.The battery life has been mediocre since the beginning, you can't delete apps you don't use from the homescreen, screen quality is not there, apps that are available for the fire are not well optimized for use on this tablet, speed is abysmal, and now the shopping app is no longer supported and you have to use the terrible silk browser.With as much money as Amazon has they could've developed a far better tablet.Lesson learned and never again.",,,,
0,,,"Wish my old Fire still worked, My old kindle fire was far easier to use than the new version which is cluttered with screen after screen that requires Alexa - which I don't have or need.  The number of ads when you play a game can be ridiculous if you don't know how to X out of the game screens, even then it takes me about 20 minutes,  Battery life is much poorer than the old Fire - or all those commercials are draining it.  I guess I'll end up paying to get rid of ads, but not unless I'm 100% sure it will get rid of all the game ads.  The cover makes it hard to open and close - I have a second cover I bought by mistake but have tried it and it didn't fit well either.  It's less than half as good as my old Fire due to this Alexa stuff that I don't understand and, from what I've read, don't need,  So sad they ruined this device - I tend to have a lot of hospital stays and this isn't really fit to take to the hospital unless I can find one of my books to read.  and there is a power outlet nearby. And why is Safari STILL the web browser?  Terribly disappointed even with a discounted price.",,
1,Cheapest tablet I’ve ever owned! Not only is this thing a steaming pile of hot advertisements but two days after I bought it it was telling me there was water in the device when I have never got it wet or brought it anywhere moist total let down don’t waste your money.,,,,
2,,,,,Fire hd tablet 8 Don't gave options to download other games! Like playstore only games that's already on there
3,,,,Better than a Kindle Paper White I like the clear screen and the ability to access my email. What I don't like is not being able to reduce the size of the program screen I'm looking at and see the other program icons. If you're reading Kindle it comes back up on Kindle and because there is no paper instruction book it's been hard to figure out how to get to other apps from the open screen.,
4,,"Worth it. I bought this for my 2 yr old after going through 3 other kids tablets. (2 from Walmart, 1 from khols) and this by far is hands down the simplest and easiest to use even for my 2 yr old. Holds charge great, touch screen is great, sound and display also great! So happy about it, I bought another one!",,,
5,,Quality for the price Easy to set up. Even these nontechnical 70 year olds could figure it out. Has everything and more that we wanted for features.,,,
6,Not impressed! Want to return and get my money back. Wasn't as big as we thought it would be.  Doesn't do the things my other tablet does and not easy to do anything with it.  Only can read a book with it.  Not impressed .  What QVC explained about the tablet was not correct!!  Need to know how to return and get my money back for 2 tablets?,,,,
7,,,,It freezes up a lot I love the color and the screen has a great picture. I also like the ability to take pictures.,

 omg i Love this kindle tablet . i remember when the first kindle fire came out .. so cool ! to be honest i think its way better than an ipad and literally so much less in the price because i like how they have selected apps that u can get on here so i only have pinterest and a few others like hbo max and netflix . and since it connects to my amazon account everything is set up and connected there where as with apple its like its connected to my phone since they use the same apple id . like a mini phone in ur hand lol that's what i hated but the kindle fire is so rad and swaggy. if ur thinking twice i would just get it :D oh and the card reader is so cool ?! i didnt know it had that and the plum color is so cute:)",,,

I got it for my little to watch her cartoons but it's so freaking slow and unresponsive. we waited 30 minutes for youtube to load up and after choosing a video it wouldn't even play because it was lagging so much. not to mention, it takes 6 hours to charge to full battery. I tried to save money by buying something other than apple but now I'll have to. at least I know it'll respond when I tap on something",,,,

It is running a SharpTools dashboard under the FullyKiosk browser in full screen mode.  It's absolutely perfect for this use case. Rock solid stable and more than powerful enough to make everything run nearly instantaneously. The camera serves to wake up the display when it senses motion. The microphone wakes up the screen when it hears noise and also acts as an Alexa device for audio control.It's truly perfectly suited for this. And the price was crazy low.Big thumbs up!",,,

4,,,,,"Only as good as its apps (terrible) Got this in hopes of being able to work on my artwork on the go. But Amazon's Appstore is extremely barren of working, useful apps. Which you kind of need, on a smart device. They only have like 4 drawing apps, and they all suck. The rest are primarily kids games, streaming platforms, and scam apps selling anywhere from $.99 to $49 (really saw that, on a camera app??). A lot of the ""apps"" just take you to the web browser version, including discord. Very strange to not have all the most basic popular apps of the day.It lags terribly with my stylus pen, doesn't draw where I'm actually putting my pen/finger, shows ads every 2 seconds, and without any decent drawing apps, I'll probably end up returning it.Extremely disappointing. All it needs is to support Google play and it would be like 75% more useful. Kinda feeling played by bezos rn. Here's hoping I didn't throw out the packaging."

Has worked great for watching movies, e-mail, internet, etc.  What is missing big time is Amazon's decision to not allow installing Google Play and downloading useful apps.

Amazon needs to let installing Google Play to be really competitive with $400 Apple mini-pad. Its just good business decision."

On my older tablet the on/off button was at the far end of the top of the tablet. Otherwise, it is easy to use .",,,

If you just want to read digital books, play basic mobile games, or watch movies/shows then it’s perfect but not for anything else. The Amazon apps it comes preloaded with (mainly the Amazon App Store) are just really weird and and very limited.

Then I thought perhaps it was the cover I bought for it not granting me full access to the buttons, but after removing the cover and paying attention to the buttons  it still has a tendency to turn itself off, mostly when changing from landscape to portrait an visa versa. When I went to try to send it back to trade for a new one, the 1 month return period had run out, so I'll just deal with it. Funny thing, I find myself using both my older Fire tablets more frequently than the new one. They works fine less the battery running out.",,

Pensé al compararla que seía una tablet muy básica, sin embargo para mi sorpresa ha sido la más funcional de todas las que he tenido.Tiene excelente rendimiento a persar de mu memoria RAM, tiene poco LAG y en general es muy fluída.Le he descargado más de 50 app y todavía no ha llegado a su límite la memoria a persar que la mía es de 32Gb.Se conecta muy bien a internet tanto en 2.4Ghz como en 5Ghz, el Blutooth funciona excelente, sólo le faltaría un infrarojo para controlar los televisores.De vez en cuando veo películas en este dispositivo y tienes excelente fluidez de imagen y sonido. acepta la mayoría de las Apps de Streaming mas importantes.Se integran excelente con el resto de los otros productos amazon que poseo, aunque Alexa a veces no es muy efectiva con los comandos.Recientemente descubrí, que al conectarlo con mi teléfono móvil por medio de un cable tipo C - C la tablet empieza a recargarse y desde el teléfono puedo acceder directamente a los archivos de la tablet tanto de la memoria interna como de la memoria externa.Con respecto a la cámara no puedo opinar, no he realizado fotos con ella ni hecho videollamadas.Si se hace necesario una batería de mayor capacidad, pero en mi caso que sólo uso la tablet en mi hogar no representa mayor problema al poderla cargarla facilmente. Pero si alguien va a usarla en el trabajo o de viaje, si debe considerar un PowerBank o conectarla a la corriente eléctrica por lo menos una vez a en la tarde. Pero con un cargador de carga rápida hace este trabajo muy rápido.A pesar de ser una tablet bastante barata, no tiene nada que envidiarle a alguna que le doble en precio, de hecho esto considerando compar la FIRE HD 8 PLUS.",,,
3,,,,,YouTube Kids is a No I really dislike that this products doesn’t have the ability to have actual apps. A lot of apps are from 3rd parties. I bought this tablet for my daughter and she can’t even watch what I got it for which is YouTube kids. She can watch PBS Kids but the content on there is very limited and not really advanced for her. I also dislike the Alexa. Press the wrong button and it’s hard to get back to the original home page. I’m 29 and having a hard time so I can imagine someone younger or older having an issue as well. It’s not the easiest to use tablet

I tried taking a picture of a beautiful sunset, And none of the colors showed up. Very disappointed. I also cannot find a help button or menu. To address problems or make adjustments. The settings menu is very limited as to what you can actually change or adjust. I only paid $44 for this so It's not worth the time or expense to return it to QVC.

I looked at new Kindles, but pricewise the Fire was a better option than the Paperwhite Kindle that I had thought about purchasing.  I have a larger one for gameplay and bought this one strictly for reading and it works great for that purpose.  I am enjoying my purchase daily.",,,

5,,,Downgraded tablet The software is downgraded Android platform without the google software. You have to get apps from the amazon app store and that place sucks. The amazon app store has some basics like facebook and youtube but other then that no apps from the google play store. I would give this a higher star if google software was supported.,,
6,,Great product This is a great little tablet! It does everything I hoped it would.,,,
7,,,,"Excellent tablet for the price but not a powerhouse I've owned a few Kindle Fires since the very first one. I got this one on sale for $50. Really you can't beat the price for all of the features that you get. I like the new ""Alexa"" integration which turns the Kindle HD into an ""Echo Show"".The only ""downsides"" are:1. It can be a little slow sometimes... but really for $50 that is actually expected and can be overlooked.2. The amazon App store is really small compared to the standard Google app store so there is a lot less available to download. Which leads us into... #33. The other thing that I don't like about the Kindle Fire tablets is that there's never been any integrated native support for Google apps or the play store which is ironic because you can access Amazon apps from non-Amazon android devices. It _can_ be done (I've done it on mine) but it takes a little bit of ""googling"" and technological tinkering to get it to work correctly. Definitely not an option for users who are not tech savvy.",

In the case my latest one is stuck in the boot screen. less than 9 months old, still eligable for replacement according to the purcahse page, but I've been told by customer service it's not eligilbe and I should just buy another.  This device is brand new, looks like it just came out of the box.  There's no way I'm going to buy yet another when it can simply decide on its own to start turning on.  My past Kindle fire's have failed similarly, though they've usually lasted a bit longer than this one.  I am strongly against buying future kindle devices mostly due to the poor customer experience I've had.  It took over 30 minutes on the phone for them to tell me I should buy another one.

6,,,,,"there's a reason this is cheaper than the competition This doesn't seem to be a bad tablet per say, but was disappointed enough to send it back after a week.  My first issue is many of the game apps I had on my old tablet had no equivalent available on this.  Second even after getting the one with more memory, there were a bunch of included apps that I had no use for and could not delete, leaving room for only 3-4 of my choosing before running out of memory.  The final straw was twice it apparently heard someone mention a tv show that we've never watched, then that night turn on the tv when that show is on it goes straight to that channel which we never watch.  giant NOPE!  I think it's probably a decent enough tablet, but there's a few reasons the price is so much lower than the competition.  If you're aware of this and ok with it, you might enjoy it.  If you're not ok with this, look elsewhere"

3,,,,FIRE works! I’ve always had iPads but bought a fire recently. I have npbeen pleasantly surprised!!!,
4,,"Love this tablet. Hate the ads. This is my 3rd Kindle Fire and I really resent having to pay to remove ads from the last two. Amazon explanatiin is they gave me a discount to display ads. I reviewed my order and that is not true. I do recall something on the setup that flashed about settings for ads and I may have bypassed it in my eagerness to use my Fire. I also do not like the way Amazin took over my Fire with this years device updates. I liked my old setup and would have preferred the optiin to retain or use new as Window does. My biggest beef is how much more difficult it is to use primarily as an e-reader. I liked the old way where my books and library were displayed and if I wanted to venture off to Facebook or email, I coukd go to those app icons. I do not like this defined dashboard concept.  But I did choose to stick with a Kindle rather than buy an ipad or other brand because of the great Amazon Prime Day price. And I thiught I would have less new stuff to learn.",,,

No video at all. Got a new one from customer service in less than 24 hours. And it works great!",,,

I'm a big reader and researcher so I use the Kindle more than anyone else I've ever met lol. I constantly have it in for games movies books etc and the battery life is pretty good considering my old fire couldn't hold s charge period.

0,"Destroys Book Navigation I have several Greek to English Bible books that worked GREAT on a Kindle Paperwhite and work well on an iPad. I wanted a larger screen and got a Kindle Fire HD 8.  The navigation is broken on this unit.  When you click on a Greek word to get a definition, and then try to go back to the page you were reading, it doesn't work. It goes to the entire Kindle Library, e.g.  Unfortunately, I have had similar issues with other biblical language resources on this Kindle.  It is hard to select by dragging, swiping or pressing to get  to the tables of contents,  Going back takes you to the first page of the book, not the last page you have read.  Selecting navigation within a book is hit or miss. Most times I get kindle settings and not tables of content,  the back button takes you to the library, not the last page.  Etc.

6,,,,,"More Problems I bought this 8"" Fire because it seemed a good value for $50 and because my old Android Ver. 7 tablet was showing its age, getting very slow and sometimes freezing up entirely.  The good news is that the new tablet is much faster and somewhat smoother in operation.  The bad news is that many apps on the old tablet that would work offline don't seem to work offline on this one.  I'm often not in a Wi-Fi hotspot.  I use tablets mainly for reading and for playing some games against the computer.  On the old tablet once I downloaded a book or a game I didn't need an internet connection to read it or play it.  On this Fire tablet, all the built-in apps and the ones from the Amazon Appstore don't seem to work right if I'm not online.  I keep getting messages like ""Internal Service Failure.""  I even have problems reading Kindle books I've already downloaded when I'm offline.  Very frustrating.  I've recently tried 'sideloading' some Android APK apps and some of them appear to work offline, but I shouldn't have to be doing this!  BTW, the price I'm seeing for this tablet has recently gone up a lot, and at $90 it's not a good value for the money.Update: I'm downgrading the rating for this tablet from 3 stars to 1 star.  It froze on me and refused to work right until I had it 'forget' the SD card.  So, of course, it lost all the apps and documents I had put on the SD card.  This tablet has been much more aggravation than it's worth.  I may try just using it with internal storage only and no SD card.Final Update: I managed to get the tablet working again, and now I think I understand what the problem was with the SD card.  I should have set it as PTP transfer rather than internal storage.  Who knew, and the software didn't explain it that well.  However, now that I've calmed down a bit, I'm upgrading my review to 2 stars.  That seems fair."
7,,,,"Does not recognize items not downloaded from Amazon I bought this for my mother who is blind. While it works great for the audible books and movies downloaded from Amazon, Alexa does not recognize anything I add from my personal collection.

5,,,"Disappointing... I received the Fire tablet as a Christmas gift in 2020.  Overall, it functions ""reasonably"" well, but what it doesn't do well overrides its functioning capabilities.  The battery life is terrible.  It does not hold well or for long.  It also takes forever to charge.  I would think in the world of fast charging, it would be a no brainer, to incorporate fast charge with their tablet.  It also takes too long to load an app, even Kindle.  It's slow, poor battery life and takes forever to charge which is bad for a tablet.  Even more so since I don't use it like a normal tablet and that's why.  I also don't like their ""Silk"" Internet-based app.  It doesn't do well at all with Internet searches.  It's less than two years old, but it performs as if it's ancient and this has been going on prior to it being a year old.  Initially, I uploaded my Gmail account, but just ran into problems even with that and removed it when it was less than a year old.  The only thing that I use it for is my Kindle books, to play Solitary, Amazon shopping (of course it works great for that) and the Overdrive app to retrieve e-books from my library.  Otherwise, it functions poorly and I cannot recommend it.  They definitely need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",,
6,,,,"pretty snappy, nice form factor What I like: the form factor, the lightness, the battery life, and the Alexa interactivity (very useful, unlike Siri who often says she has no idea what I just said), the bright screen, and Kindle/e-reader. Also love USB-C charging. I bought one game on this--Stardew Valley. Highly recommend ;)What I'm not crazy about: the app store seems a bit light on good stuff (I know Google is a competitor, but no Youtube??), sometimes performance is a bit laggy; like you're scrolling and it studders a bit.",

The Kindle Fire HD 8 is a good replacement for my Nook. It is also a very good tablet. It took me only a couple of days to get used to the device. It is actually not that much different from an Android device. You will have to side load the Google Play Store to get some of your favorite apps. Otherwise, I had no problem with speed or functionality of the Kindle. However, I am not all that happy with the screen. It is a slightly dull finish that seems to attract fingerprints out of thin air. My other devices have fingerprint resistant screens which are great. This is the only fault that I have found so far.",

I have called Amazon's help technicians three times in the 2 months I have had it. (And, yes, they resolved each issue I had at the time.) The most irritating issue with this Kindle is that it has a mind of its own sometimes: it insists that I really do want to activate Alexa (I do not); it sometimes shuts itself off when I put it down, and refuses to turn back on until I plug it into an electric circuit; and it interrupts Netflix once in a while to ask me to at least look at what Alexa can do. My other two Kindles, earlier versions, did not have Alexa, and I am convinced that this robot thingie is the real problem. But, as one technician dolefully explained, ""It is incorporated so you cannot delete it."" Arghhh!But the screen and image quality is fine, good enough to enjoy the nature and animal shows I love on Netflix. And it doesn't run out of battery after my full day of print and scenic ventures.

It seems to work fine, but if you start doing multiple things on it, or try to zip around on it, it gets slow and sluggish.  We have owned various fire tablets over the years and this seems to be a common thing among them all.  Even through these are much newer models than the one we had years ago, they still have that same sluggishness.  It might be the OS or it could just be the cheaper ram or cpu they use to have such low costs.

I can't get Netflix or hulu, the Amazon store app doesn't work they direct you to use the internet app they have and only have cheesy scam downloads of Google Chrome and such. This used to be the best tablet you could buy. Now I'd say it's only barely worth the money.When I went to register they wanted a verification code... but I couldn't reduce the window or leave the window to go and check Gmail on their silk app. I mean I bought this to use and they make it so you need a computer or smart phone to just get it working.Who ever did this to the once master piece of tablets that rivaled or bested iPad...is now just OK. I hope they fix everything with an update.This makes me lose confidence in Amazon.The display cast feature was non existent, the app store was a joke', the whole basic functionality was a joke. The camera is blurry... but the screen is great and so is the touch and buttons... but all the OS of it and apps just terrible.They really ruined one of the best tablets ever.I want a serious os update.

8,,,"Overall an excellent product for the price! Okay, let me start by saying that I am currently on my second fire tablet.  The first was a gift from my last job and was an Amazon Fire 7 2017 edition.  It was, as one would expect from a cheap tablet, very slow and low quality.  However, it was still a great tablet for the price.  I believe that they were running somewhere around $50-$75 at the time I received it and regardless of the quality, it worked far better than any smartphone I had seen around the same price.  I was able to expand memory and I used it for personal and professional services for almost 4 years.  So it definitely served its purpose.  Last year my wife was tired of me always complaining about how slow it had gotten and how limited it was on being able to keep up with newer apps.  So she bought me an Amazon Fire HD 8 2021 for Christmas in the hopes that it would fix the issues I was having with my 2017 model.  That brings me to the real point of this review.  Having used this tablet for almost a year now I can say again that this is an excellent tablet for the price.  I only have a few complaints that I was hoping Amazon had fixed since the 2017 model.1) The screen is just not bright enough.  It's fine when you are inside in a low light area but when you walk outside, especially on a sunny day, you can't see anything on the screen.  That's with the brightness level at max and adaptive brightness turned off. (Wanted to clarify for those of you who might think I don't know what I'm doing)2) The screen lags when switching between apps and when loading apps.  This was a major problem with the 2017 Fire 7 but I had hoped that, with all of Amazon's internal hardware and software upgrades that it would be faster but it's about the same still.  It's just definitely not made for multi-tasking or gaming really.  You can multi-task but it's difficult due to the lag.  However, it's a great option for those of you who just want to binge watch your favorite movies and shows on streaming apps and/or use it for ebooks, music, or shopping.3)  The battery life is about the same as my 2017 which was also very disappointing.  On a full charge I can usually get about 4-5 hours of solid use before it's almost dead (that was brand new), about 8-10 hours of intermittent use, and if left on but inactive (on standby) you can get up to 3 days on a full charge before it dies.  However I will also say that those numbers have not decreased much, if any, over the past 8 months of use.  So at least the battery life seems to be fairly consistent.4) While the tablet is very ""user friendly"", it's not very good for those of you who like to poke around the more technical side of things.  You basically have to download a bunch of secondary apps to read or change deeper settings than what you see on the basic menu.*IMPORTANT NOTICE*You should never change or alter the programming of any device.  Doing this can damage your device, void manufacturer warranties, and may even be illegal in some cases.  So make sure you know what the manufacturer as well as your local and federal law allows before you do anything that can alter or potentially harm your device.  All repairs, alterations, and any other changes should always be handled by the manufacturer or other industry professionals who are trained to work on your specific device.To sum it all up, remember that this is a cheap tablet so don't expect your Fire to keep up with the latest iPad because it can't.  That being said, it really is a good tablet overall. Especially when you consider that the closest thing to it from another company would cost you at least twice as much.  So for the very last time I'll say, it's an excellent tablet for the price!  Thank you",,

5,,,,,"Purchased for classroom use. Most frustrating experience I have ever had. Device:  Kindle Fire 8 (10th Generation)I purchased 8 of these Fire tablets for use in an elementary classroom.  They were to be used exclusively to access the Myon ereader app through our district’s Clever page.  Sounded simple enough!  Yet, I have had the most frustrating experience with educational technology I have ever had.First, I set up a child’s profile so that I could limit what the students had access to.  The child’s profile comes preloaded with 100 videos/apps on the home screen!  It was insane!  (Note that this is not the “Kids” Fire, just a regular one with a child profile set up.)  It took 4 different customer serv agents and about 3 hours to finally find someone who could tell me how to turn them off.  It ended up being a simple toggle, so how could that many people not know how?  (This was after I had searched through multiple threads online from frustrated parents with the same issue.)  FYI, in the child’s profile, toggle off the option to Enable web access.  However, this means that you will then have to go in an Allow Content for every app that you do want them to access as well as allow every web page they can go to.  For me, not a huge deal because I bought these for one specific purpose, but as you will see below, even that was a ridiculously frustrating process.After figuring out the toggle solution, I started going into the settings of each Kindle to set them up.  On the 8th and final Kindle, it didn’t work.  After restarting and then trying to power off/wait/power on, I finally decided to delete the profile and reinstall it.  Upon doing this, the child profile interfaces of ALL 8 tablets completely changed.  The original wallpaper/setup was single solid light blue page with cloud outline in background.  After I reinstalled the profile, the wallpaper was a black/aqua/purple paint splatter with a “For Me”, “Home”, and some other tab.  Under the For Me tab were ALL the videos and apps that I had disabled access to.  Even though the toggle was set to disable, they were all back and could be opened.  I then factory reset the device, and it still didn’t work.  I finally tried to create yet another new child profile, and then it finally went back.  No rhyme or reason.So, now to the task of setting them up for Myon.  I downloaded the Myon app, but it would not work.  I think this was an issue on our district permission side.  (And even though I did a press/hold and told it to remove the app from the profile and then completely deleted Myon from my account via the Content and Devices setting of my Amazon.com account, it was still showing up!  And if the child tapped it, it became stuck in a loop of trying to install an app that was no longer there.)  Anyway, I was told by our Academic Tech dept to go through the Clever app.  Guess what – it’s not available on the Amazon app store.  So, I had to go through the web.  In the Allow Content section of Settings, you can allow specific websites, which is great.  However, even though I allowed the website to access Clever, at every step, the child’s profile web browser said no permission.  I had to enable every single page the kids will go through to get to their Myon account, and even then they have to know to navigate around an “Uh oh” page that still pops up every time, even though I allowed it.Because of this, I needed to make step-by-step instructions by taking screenshots so I could print for the kids so they could remember all these steps.  However, screenshots taken while in child’s profile cannot be located anywhere, not in the child or adult profiles.  (Camera and photo storage had been enabled.)  Regular photos taken with the camera could be found in the photos app, and I found an online thread suggesting going through the Files app, but they are nowhere to be found.  I can’t take the screenshots in the adult profile because the screen looks completely different.  I spent 20 minutes on chat with a CSR this morning only to be told he would ‘notify the team.’  The threads I read about this same issue were from 2020 and 2021, so I’m sure they know and have chosen not to fix it.My multiple chat sessions were also frustrating.  With this particular one, I took the time to write out, in detail, the exact steps I followed, only to have him ask – two separate times - if I had tried something that I had already said I tried.  I had this same issue with other CSR chats.  These are the least knowledgeable CSRs I have ever dealt with.  One, named Jestin, kept telling me to tap the Menu button, and there was not a menu button on my screen.  After hanging up with her, I continued to research online, and found the exact script she was using, and it was for a Kindle eReader, not a Fire!  She didn’t even have the right device, and she kept getting very angry with me when I couldn’t follow her instructions.  She kept me on hold for 10 minutes when I asked to speak with someone else, then came back on and (unsurprisingly) said she couldn’t find anyone else.I usually have great customer service with Amazon, but they have truly failed with their training related to the Kindle Fire devices.  They would have me wait for 10 minutes sometimes, only to come back and ask me to try something that I had already told them I tried.Almost every single thing I have tried to do with these has required me to spend an inordinate amount of time researching previous threads, chatting online with a specialist, or on the phone.  It took 3 separate calls to finally get someone who was willing to take over my Fire so they could see what I was seeing, and even so, I still cannot use them in the way that I need to.  You definitely get what you pay for, I guess.  Such a shame when teachers have to use their own money to provide these opportunities for their students.  I have wasted hours of my time and a lot of my money.  I hope I can save another teacher some of this endless frustration."

9,,,,,"Probably Great if You're an Amazon Centric User I took advantage of the Prime Day deal because I figured why not have a decent color tablet for $40-ish dollars. I have an old ipad that I now only use for reading books, so it's not worth my spending several hundred dollars to replace it. But the Fire was discounted for a reason: to suck you into the Amazon ecosystem. It's even more restricted than an Apple device. I mostly read my own DRM free public domain books, which I have no trouble uploading to an iPad. But the Fire is a real PITA when it comes to setting it up the way I want. You can find work-arounds online, but I just haven't had the patience to deal with it yet. Plus, I didn't consider the cost of a case, and decent ones seem to be at least $20-$30 (and that's if you're okay with hideous colors or designs). Without a case I can't just throw it in a bag and carry it around. So now we're looking at $70-$80 plus hours of my valuable time to research and implement work arounds  just so I can read a book. At this rate I should have just shelled out a bit more for a Samsung tablet."

It did everything I wanted it to do so I thought this would be the exact same but with a usb-c port that wouldn't break after time.Idk what they changed or if I just got a bad one but since day one it has been a piece of junk. The browser crashes on me any time it takes too long to load a page. I can't make it past the first page of Amazon without it crashing to the home screen. I never NEVER get notifications as they come in but rather hours later.The worst thing is messenger for Facebook. This worked fine on the older tablet but I don't get notifications on this one. Yes, I've gone through ALL the settings and there's no reason I shouldn't get them. It's like if the app isn't open it doesn't work. So I miss calls from family members all the time. My family lives in a different country and my dad and grandma both passed away this year so it was so important for me to get these calls. :(It's not just messenger but my blink cameras don't send me alerts when they record movement unless I open the app. Then suddenly all the notifications come flooding in. What good is this going to be if someone's trying to get into my house?Every now and again the screen will go black and none of the buttons will wake it up. But you can see a back light, so the tablet isn't completely off. I need to mash all the buttons down and hold them all for a minute or so to do some sort of hard boot. The thing about this is, I don't notice until later in the day that the tablet had crashed. And I miss a lot of messages from family this way.Ended up buying a cell phone and getting a phone plan so that I don't have to deal with this thing anymore. It'll now become a toy for my 1 yr old.",,,,
9,"I will never spend a dime on any ""fire"" tablet again This thing is completely useless. Its almost as bad (possibly worse) than an i-pad.My intended use for this tablet was to give to my daughter to use for taking photos, surfing the internet, watching youtube videos, playing games on, etc. in other words, just something for her to play around with. I didnt want to spend a large amount of money on a top-of-the-line tablet. But maybe I should have, this thing was a complete waste of 65 bucks.1. every time I restart it, or every 15 minutes or so of using it, it comes up with a window asking me to ""connect to Alexa"".... I dont use an Alexa. I skip past it, and roughly 15 minutes later (the exact timing seems somewhat random, but I would guess thats an average interval), it interrupts whatever I am doing and asks me again. really annoying.2. You cant uninstall (or even disable) all, or any, of the pre-loaded ads and crap that Amazon loads on there for you. You cant even delete the icons from the home screen (for that matter you cant even customize the main screen, aside from re-arranging the icons, see below) so the home screen is completely filled with a bunch of apps that she nor I will ever use.3. you cant load new apps on it (I presume if the app is from Amazon you might be able to, but anywhere else, forget about it. (now that's an ""Apple"" move in every definition of it, and one of the biggest reasons why I am not an Apple fan!)4. See above, I mentioned you cannot customize the home screen. I literally mean, you CANT customize it at all, except for re-arranging the positions of the icons. You cant change the background image. nope, no option in the settings anywhere to do that. You cant remove icons that you dont use from it. You cant add icons to it (well since you cant install any new apps, I guess they figure you wont need that feature.) you cant remove or turn off the ""news"" feeds (weather, headlines, 'recommended' BS, etc. (which constantly use data by the way as they are constantly downloading their updates).5. The volume will randomly turn up whenever it wants to play some sound. When I turn the volume all of the way down (because its 1am and I dont want to disturb anyone sleeping), and im going along and then suddenly when it tries to show a video, or I get a notification or something, instead of operating in silence, the volume is suddenly turned up to 70% and making noise it goes. I frantically turn it back down, look around sheepishly making sure that didnt disturb anyone, and then carry on. But then next time it wants to play something, that volume goes back up with no input from me. whats the point of having a volume control, if its just going to adjust itself anyway.Im hoping if you are reading this, that you will find it useful and hopefully, wont make the same mistake I did. Im going to go buy a Samsung device (galaxy tab or similar), yes they are twice the cost. but at least they actually work. and let you install your own apps, customize them to get them working the way you want. etc. and I hope you will do the same, but hopefully, skipping the step of wasting cash on a ""fire"" tablet trying to save a few bucks first. Thanks for reading.",,,,
0,"Died after 14 months It completely died after just 14 months of use, and of course this is just two months past the return window. It also doesn't have a built in sleep function, making it fairly useless for those of us that fall asleep to noise.",,,,
1,,Freezes up frequently. It hasn’t worked right from the start. Nonresponsive screen even after being reset several times. A total waste of money.,,,
2,,"Great tablet and amazing price I have the fire in a few sizes and I love them all. I have one to watch youtube, prime, and netflix in my room at night as I don't have a tv, and another that I use for reading, email, podcasts, ect.  I love physical books but it's so much easier to have this in my bag to read on my lunch break, downtime at work, etc. I can also check my email, shop, and listen to podcasts. For me, it's a steal for the price as I cannot spend hundreds of dollars on a certain brand of tablet. The 7 and 8 inch are great for on the go and the 10 works as my at home bedroom tv.",,,
3,,,,New Kindle 8 Replaced my 6 year old K 8.  This is a great size for reading and travel.  The overall footprint is a little smaller than my 2016 K 8.  Of course everything is much faster.  The only slight surprise is that the volume of music is about 20% less than my old model.  But it works well and the purchase price during some prime event was very low.,

5,,Great product for the price Purchased during Prime day sale.  Great value and great product for what I need,,,
6,Don't purchase unless you have higher internet speed The product did not work in my area so I returned it immediately. Five weeks later I'm stll waiting for refund. Then I got the product back again which I'm not going to pay to return. I'll give it to someone with a higher internet speed than I have.,,,,
7,,,,"You get what u pay for... Sometimes it dies randomly. When I put it on the charger, it always still has battery left, never on 0%.I was able to install the Google play store. That's a plus. But it doesn't support the ads to get free things (cheats) in the games.",

0,,"Convenient size.  Great price. This is my third Amazon Fire.  I only got a new one because I dropped my previous one, and didn't have it in a case.  This time, I wisely got a ""jacket"" for it, and insurance.  I use it every day.I highly recommend it.",,,
1,,,,"Reading Tool This Firer tablet is great for reading, but not outside. It’s Lao good for watching a movie, or playing solitaire. I’m not one to stay on a device to long. It works for me.",
2,,,,,Not worth it in the end So in my opinion this tablet is not worth it I have come to find that a lot of Amazon Brand products really aren't that great. The screen quality could be way better and if you're getting this for a child for educational purposes most of the educational games/apps will not be available on this tablet you really do better off spending the money on a Samsung tablet or a good quality android brand tablet. I returned my tablet a week later because all of the educational apps for my 9-year-old were unavailable.
3,,,Not as good as the old Kindle Fire 2010 I had an old Fire that is no longer upgradeable but was faster and had an awesome feel & great screen. This is a replacement under warranty for a new one (2021)  and it's having the same technical issue the original did they replaced. Replacement process was very badly handled. Speed slow & screen sub- standard to old Kindles (2010). If old one was upgradeable I would have never bought a new one.,,
4,,Tablet Very nice,,,
5,"Doesn't connect to Wi-Fi Got two of these during the holidays. Mine worked fine for a little bit. Last month it wouldn't connect to Wi-Fi.  Called customer service and Saud I would have to reset it to fix it. Didn't want to cause I would lose what I had. So I listened to them an hit reset. Still won't connect. They said they would send me 15% off for a new one. Never got it. Mind you, this is a new tablet only about 8 months. They said warranty ran out in March. That's horrible! It's a shame cause I did like it. Not buying a fire tablet again. So disappointed!!",,,,

The replacement I received had a broken power button and would only turn on when connected to a power outlet. To get that replaced, I had to agree to accept a refurbished tablet, despite paying for a new and functional one that never arrived. I decided that it's not worth the hassle. I'm done with Amazon devices.",,,,

6,,Great tablet at a reasonable price. Going to use it while traveling. Beautiful color screen. Great for reading on plane.,,,
7,,,"Poor Sound I like this. I want to use it more, but it’s just not loud enough. I have to charge a Bluetooth speaker to make it work for me. On a plane, cool. On vacation, reading a book, cool. But, my iPhone gets better sound which then becomes my default. If I’m just reading a book on a bigger screen, it’s perfectly fine.",,
8,,,,"It's OK. Amazon had a sale on fire 8. Paid less than $80 ad free. It's fine, does what it needs to do. Camera doesn't pick up QR codes, need to download an app. Apps take a few seconds to open, slowest response time of any tablet/phone I have used. Batter life is good, screen is fine. Once in a while it semi restarts and i have to log into prime again for tablet to work. That part is annoying. Doesnt hap often though.  For the money it's really good.  I can't complain.",
9,,,,,I hope for more. Slow Not what I expected. My iPhone is so much better. I’ll keep it but probably give it to one of my grandkids. My wife doesn’t use it at all.
0,,"Perfect for my needs! I bought this to replace an older one for a light and portable platform for book reading and to play games on.  The old one still functions great after five years, but I felt an upgrade was in order, so opted for one the same size.  I decided not to go with the bigger model simply because I already had something in that size in the form of my iPad, and going with a bigger one would defeat my reason for going smaller and lighter.  So far I've been extremely happy with it.  While it's no speed demon, I didn't buy it for that, so I'm very happy with its performance.  The big key I see in being happy with this is using it for what it's intended for and not as an iPad type replacement.  If you're looking for a speedy platform that can handle all sorts of video play, then this is not for you.  If you want something that will handle book reading, watching Prime videos on, or just playing some games, then you will not go wrong with this.  The price is hard to beat for what you're getting.  I'm very happy with both my tablets!!",,,
1,Horrible Horrible. Extremely difficult to use.,,,,
2,,Good Resolution while reading Really like the clear screen while reading. It’s not hazy in any of the apps installed. I like it better than my iPad because I can hook up to other devices or printers. I don’t like all the ads. Way too many.,,,

5,"I hate it I’ve had this tablet for two years but barely ever use it. The problems with it started a few months after I bought it and I wish I returned it as soon as the issues began. I’ll never buy a tablet again, Nvmd an Amazon brand!! About a month or two after purchasing it in 2020 the battery life deteriorated quite rapidly. I had to charge it every two or three hours! And don’t get me started on the poor touch screen and delayed scrolling! When using apps and scrolling through them sometimes it’ll click on something I’m scrolling past. Sometimes scrolling is delayed and other times the screen will scroll or zoom in a totally different way when all I’m doing is scrolling up and down! Also, apps crash like it’s nothing! I seriously despise this device and it’s brand. I do NOT recommend at all. Even my mom has an Amazon tablet that’s about 2” bigger than mine and it has the same issues as mine and that began about two months or so after she purchased it. Is it too late for a return/refund for this lousy thing…??!! I don’t understand what the hype is all about and where all these good reviews are coming from.",,,,

1,,"Great Tablet For The Price! I snagged one of these on Prime Day. I use it to watch workout videos while using my water rowing machine. It works very well for that purpose, and the battery life is pretty good!The touch screen works as you'd expect. The only downside is the lack of gesture control. I'm used to doing things like swiping to the left across my screen to go back, as I do on my phone, and whenever I use my Fire tablet, I have to catch myself and remember to use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen. I'll have to dig into the settings one day and see if that can be changed.It would be nice to use Google apps and a version of Android that is closer to what is currently available, but I get it; it's an Amazon product, meant to work primarily in the Amazon ecosphere, not Google's. I understand that I can sideload the Google Play Store and possibly use a Google launcher, but I have just enough knowledge to be dangerous. It's the reason I end up switching back to Windows from Linux on my laptop. After I tinker enough, I invariably muck up some important setting and can't figure out how to switch it back. I don't want that to be the case with this tablet, as I might not be able to revert to factory as easily as in Windows.The keyboard is also a pain to use, since I prefer Gboard, or even Swiftkey or Swype, but I'm not planning to write any speeches or research papers on it, so the Amazon keyboard will do for my purposes.For the price, it's a great device.",,,

1,Don't buy if you need Etsy!! Returned it because I needed it for Etsy shop and it does not support Etsy. Developers did not include Etsy when they designed it.I don't know anything else about it. Turned it on 30 minutes only to find this huge dissapointment.,,,,

9,"Good tablet, poor policy This is a good tablet. When on sale, it is a good value. However, beware of Amazon policy which is unlike other stores. You have 30 day to return for refund, BUT, you better hope it is not defective. I bought one as a gift for someone in need on Prime Day. After a couple weeks, it stopped working properly. It was determined by Amazon Technician thru remote access that it needed repair. So he said send back for repair. Within 30 days, shouldnt it be replaced, not repaired? Yes, it should. After all, I can return it, right? But, if I wanted to get a direct replacement, they wanted an additional $16. Why? I paid for a new one, not a refurbished one. The refurbished units cost less, and if thats what I wanted, i would have bought that in the first place. But I didn't want that. I also didn't want to wait for how long it might take to do then repair process. So, I paid the $16 just because I do a benevolent work and bought it to help someone out, and it is important to me that the gift I gave someone was new. I dont understand someone selling you something and it is broken, and they are not willing to send you a brand new one (which is what you ordered) to replace it. Its not like it was 6 months or even 3 months. It wasn't even 3 weeks. So lesson learned. Next time, buy extras, hold onto them for 29 days to make sure the ones you are using are all working, and return the ones you don't want. Sad that I had to write this over $16. In the big picture, it doesn't sound like much, but the diminished value that results is very frustrating, and if this happens to others, then it adds up. So, its a good tablet, I have bought many of them over the years for those who can't afford to buy it, and they are happy. But this has put a dent in my process because it took time and money away from what I need to help even more people in need. So make aure to cover yourself to insure your investment value.",,,,
0,return it does not work anymore,,,,
1,,,"Disappointingly slow internet but ironically good at streaming Size, weight, quality of screen are very good. Number of apps available is limited and some are very, very slow.Most disappointing is how slowly internet browser works, whether using Silk directly or a via Google Chrome app. (WiFi strength is excellent, so that is not the issue.)Waiting for pages to load is extremely frustrating. Streaming video, however, seems to work well. Not a replacement for an iPad or tablet that runs on a more sophisticated/better developed OS.",,
2,"Tablet cant stream any app without buffering. I cant play youtube, plex or even my kids baby monitor app (Miku) on this tablet even tho I have 700 down and 200 up. App's work on all of my other devices but not this tablet.",,,,

4,,Great for young children Purchased for a Birthday gift. It is perfect.,,,
5,,,,,"Avoid this Tablet The Fire HD 8 10th Generation (Model KFONWI) should be a much better tablet, but it's not even worth the cost when on sale for half price.For a tablet design from 2020, it's incredibly slow and glitchy. Apps are slow to install and update, they often crash and close, and when switching between apps the OS will have moved the previous app from RAM into storage and has to drag it back to RAM making for a clunky experience. It comes down to (obviously) 3 things: processor, RAM, and storage.The processor Amazon has chosen for this tablet is the MediaTek MT8168. Although released in May of 2020 (especially for Amazon Fire tablet), it only uses (4) ARM Cortex-A53 4 Cores from 2012. And while the Cortex-A53 is a solid codeable ARM core at this point, it has NO PULLING POWER with most modern apps. MediaTek could have/would have been extremely happy to offered Amazon an ARM ""big.LITTLE"" SoC design with a single ARM Cortex-A73 and three Cortex-A53 Cores for pennies more! The configuration would have allowed some heaver hitting when needed with little additional power consumption over all.The processors other shortcoming is the integration of a single (1x) ARM Mali-G52 GPU. Once again, the ARM Mali-G52 is an extremely stable GPU. A dual core (2x) or quad core (4x) would provide more stable gaming/videos/app changes/tab change when using the tablet, but more GPU cores would also add more stress to system RAM and we can't have that!Here's a thought. Since ""big.LITTLE"" is outdated too, on the next gen Fire tablets switch to the UNISOC Tiger T310 processor that supports the newer DynamIQ flexibility and scalability. It stable technology from 2017 with the T310 launching in 2019. This SoC has an up-to-date single (1x) Cortex-A75 and three (3x) Cortex-A55 cores, Imagination Technologies PowerVR GE8300 (from 2014, stable and excellent for gaming). and also sports a built-in 4G LTE modem (FDD bands B1/B3/B7/B8/B20, so Europe only). Or have MediaTek make something similar.Okay, let's' talk RAM. I understand that Fire OS 7 is built on as stable a copy of Android 9 Pie as possible. But 2GB of RAM is NOT enough to satisfy the ""tweaked"" OS, a number of open apps, graphics/video streaming needs, and multiple browser tabs, even when this tablet launched in 2020. It causes apps to close/freeze/crash, slow app launch times as the OS finds a need to ""move"" a currently unused app to virtual memory in the ridiculously slow storage, and the system itself to become unstable at times! The OS appears, on a clean install, is eating up more than 1GB of RAM on every new startup.4GB of RAM is the ""sweet spot"". While even 3GB of RAM would be a tremendous step in the right direction, 4GB would make the Fire OS far happier and give even the largest of apps room to play. Even with the current lack luster SoC the change in performance would be phenomenal!Last we come storage. I'm not here to complain about the amount/size, as the tablet does offer a micro SD card slot for expansion. But there ARE two problems.First, the read/write speeds of the eMMC being used are horrible. While the read speeds are a solid 480Mb/s, the write speeds are down to only 75Mb/s! Some micro SD cards are better suited, and that's sad. And with the OS having to extend the 2GB of RAM in to the eMMC to run a small number of apps, that read/write speed is highly compromised.Second, being able to move more apps to a higher quality micro SD card could easily fix a number of problems. The read/write speeds and ""A"" application rating could be determined during the format of the card upon installation. Running more apps from a qualified micro SD, especially with additional RAM, would make for a happier tablet.Until these corrections are made, please AVOID the Fire HD 8 10th Generation (Model KFONWI)."
6,,"Glad I bought it I was updating my much older fire 7 and 8 (although both of them work just fine) to a newer version. This new fire 8 is just what I expected, longer battery life, a responsive touch screen and more. I love the size and portably and have no regrets with my purchase. I can pop it in my purse and be off and running. I did buy it during Prime Day and the price did help entice me 🙃",,,
7,,Nothing None,,,
8,,,"Some good and some less than awesome ""features"" Since Amazon Kindle dropped support for the older versions of Fire Tablets, I was urged by Amazon support to get a ""new and improved"" Kindle Fire Table 8 (10th gen), black, ad supported lock screen, 32GB unit.On the good side: With refunds and various other promotions, I was able to get one for a great price.  Also, bigger screen than my old one, more memory, and the ability to add a micro SD card for tons of storage.  Battery life seems to be a bit better and it is a few fractions of an ounce lighter.On the disappointing side: My old Kindle supported HDMI output.  My bad, I didn't do enough research and read the reviews.  After wasting my time trying to figure it out, I discovered that the USB-C port, which can support video out but doesn't on the Kindle Fire 8 (10th gen), is only for charging.  That is disappointing because I had hoped I could use it like I had my old Kindle in our travel trailer to provide entertainment content to our cheap RV TV.  Not a major issue, just a sad, disappointing fact made even sadder when I found out it won't support screen mirroring (casting) either.  It is too bad since this is advertised as ""designed for portable entertainment.""In general, it does most of what I needed, just not everything I thought it should or could.  But for what I paid for it, it's good enough.  And that is why I gave it 3 stars.  If it had video output on the USB-C port and Screen Mirroring capability -5 stars for sure.",,

The thing for me that is odd is that when I first bought this about a month ago, I was able to use the Amazon shopping app just fine. I did a system update about a week ago and now the app is no longer supported. Kind of weird in my opinion. It's an Amazon device but doesn't support the Amazon shopping app.....hmm. OK. I can still access the Amazon store through the web browser, but it was just convenient to use the app though. Other than that, a pretty good device for what I paid for it.(Edit)-Checked for any new updates and today about 11 or 12 updates popped up. I was able to manually install each of them. Amazon shopping app now working fine. Changing rating to 5 stars. Good device for what I paid for it.",,,

7,,,Excellent Price At several $hundred less than a Samsung or other branded Tablet it represents great value. Unexpected was the number of Advertisements every time one started the Tablet. With a little effort and about an hour it is possible to stop all through Settings except the Start-up advert which is usually a game but entering your PIN overcomes this. Also a bit off-putting is that searches and site icons go through Amazon Fire rather than normal channels. This Tablet replaced a 5 year old Samsung Tab unit which started going slow. Think for Gamers and Film Streamers this Tablet would probably be good: I don't play games or Stream on this Tablet but virtually all the adverts are games or films.,,

8,,Kindle is the best I read a lot and though I have only used Kindle I have to say that it is the best. It fits perfect in my hands and with the case I can drop it two stories and (it always lands in the dirt) noting ever happens to it. That right there is testimony to the product. Anyway that's all I've got to say. I love m Kindle.,,,

0,,All was great It was perfect,,,
1,,Amazing little tablet! This tablet is great and everything you would expect from Amazon. The battery life is the most impressive part of it. I sometimes forget to charge it for days but it holds for quite some time. It is absolutely perfect for reading. I haven't quite used it for gaming but so far it has never frozen or lagged on me.,,,
2,,Perfect for kids I bought these for my 8 & 9 year old kids. It's perfect for their ages. I can decide what they have access to and see what they've been spending their time on. The tables are great quality and priced well.,,,
3,,It good To read an look at videos,,,
4,,,,Great Value This HD8 is a definite improvement over my previous HD8. You can tell it has a faster processor. Since it now supports both WIFI frequencies the bandwidth is improved for faster network access. I also like that it now has the newer USB connection for charging. No more fumbling with the previous connector that had to be oriented to match the connection port. I got the advertisement model so I get an ad after I enter my passcode. No big deal and worth the discount. I expanded my storage with a 64 GB card so it makes the tablet even better. The down side for me was that I had to get a new cover since my previous HD8 was a different size.,
5,,Fire HD 8 Tablet I love my new Kinder Fire 8. It uploads fast and the screen is clear.,,,
6,,Exactly What We Needed It For! Ease of use for child age 8,,,
7,,,,,"Do not recommend There is something wrong with this generation of tablet. I bought one and it would not find my location and kept putting me in a different state. After going through about five or six people I was told that they had to contact the provider and that they would be in touch with me in 4 or 5 days. Nobody ever called me back. These things cannot find your location if something wrong with the software and until they fix it I would not recommend this product to anybody unless you just like throwing your money away. I think when you release a product you should have it test it out and know that it's working properly in all fields this does not work. Customer service cannot seem to help anybody and they say they're going to call me back and they never do. Very poor customer service very poor product. I would wait for the next generation and see if they have fixed the problem but this one is totally unacceptable. Amazon techs can't seem to help and they don't get back in touch with you so all you can do is call and start from the very beginning all over again I've done this five times and the end result is always the same they have to contact somebody and have them get a hold of me and they will get in touch with me four to five business days. Didn't happen and I don't know if it's going to. Very dissatisfied with this tablet and will recommend to everybody not to buy until they can fix the problems and take care of the customers. Very unhappy, very unsatisfied, very disturbed. I probably wouldn't be quite as mad if someone would actually contact me when they say they're going to but as of yet that hasn't happened. Don't buy it you'll be sorry"

4,"Do NOT buy this tablet-highly disappointed in Amazon I would NEVER recommend this tablet to anyone. I had my other tablet for a long time and loved it. I thought I was going to treat myself with a newer generation.I got my tablet and everything was great, until the screen started to go black randomly. It didnt matter if it was fully charged or not. The only way I could turn it back on was by plugging it in, just to go through the same thing over and over again.I contacted Amazon, which was still within my refund time, and they agreed to a replacement. When I sent it back it was deemed a “repair” not an actual replacement. I got it back and the same thing started happening. I had to re contact them and my warranty was still good so they said they would replace it. I thought a replacement was a brand new tablet, since that is what I paid for, but no its just a different refurbished or repaired tablet.I contacted them for a third time and was told there isnt anything that can be done. I just wanted a new tablet or a refund, but since my 30 days to return it had ended, they refused. I was told the warranty states that a “replacement” could be any new or refurbished device and that their “experts” run them through tests that guarantee they run like new, which clearly they dont since my first repair didnt fix anything.Extremely upset with Amazon. I have never had problems in the past, plus the attitudes of the “customer service” team was very rude.If you ever get a supervisor by the name of Aiden, hang up and try again.Hopefully my “refurbished” tablet doesnt have the same problems.",,,,

I had called AMAZON customer service, and was essentially told, I just have to plug it into a power source. Anyhow. I went ahead and decided that I would but a new one.  I did so on July 13th, 2022. It is August 4th, 2022 - not a full month. Today, my kindle  - brand new btw - will not turn on although it is fully charged. I called customer service, and I was told that I had to plug it into a power source to reboot it. So I explained that I understand that, btu what if I did not have immediate access to a power source, would I then be unable to use my kindle for an unforeseeable time. I was essentially told, yes, and made to feel like I should just ""deal with it"". I do not understand why a BRAND NEW item would not be able to turn on, and I do not understand why the customer service was so so so unhelpful. Anyhow, this is an awful experience, but I will try to be near a power outlet at all times with my brand new kindle.",,,,

0,"E-Reader Freezes When Left In The Book Purchased this ""Fire"" as an e-reader replacing Kindle Whitepaper as library switched to the ""Cloud Library."" Kindle does not support Cloud Library a problem which should be corrected.  The Kindle as an e-reader is far superior.  The kindle keeps your place in the book when you close the reader.  To return to your page simply open the reader and swipe once.  The Fire shuts down when closed at a page in the book and left for a length a time and then freezes.  To reopen it requires a connection to a power source and then reopening the Fire, then the app, and then the specific book.  Used an i pad for a while but did not like the size but did not have these difficulties.  Maybe requires the purchase of a mini i pad even though have no use for all the other functions.",,,,

After five hours of wrestling miserably with it, trying to find ways to download my b&n and cloud library apps, I gave up.  I was extremely disappointed.

What I didn’t like about the Amazon tablet is this: firstly there’s only certain apps that I was able to download a lot of apps for ex: chrome I couldn’t download, also you tube for kids I wasn’t able to either, a lot of times when I open the tablet it doesn’t let me unlock the screen which is very frustrating. I would put more stars if I wasn’t limited to downloading certain apps.

8,,,Great for price Great for price on Amazon Prime day but otherwise not worth it. Tablet is so slow and confusing to navigate. Making it kid friendly is a pain.

After looking that problem up, I got a new router from Spectrum. Now it will stay connected. However, when I try to get onto different sites, including amazon, it just buffers. I wanted to pair it with my echo dot and it shows someone else's echo dot. So, I'm done and will return it after I finish this review. Very disappointed.

4,,,,"LOVE this little tablet! When my husband and I travel, I'd pack my portable movie player, my Kindle to read, and a PC tablet to play downloaded games. However, this tablet replaces all of these gadgets. I downloaded my favorite games, Kindle library, my TV app to watch DVR recorded shows and I watch movies through my Prime subscription. It comes with a web browser as well, so I can shop, check email, etc. It's compact and light enough that I can carry it in my purse. I know smartphones can perform the same tasks, but it irritates me trying to do all of the above on a tinky, 2""x5"" screen. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because Alexa responds about 50% of the time. I've programmed multiple, common commands, yet I still get the ""...I'm sorry, I don't understand..."" or no response at all. Restarting the tablet seems to temporarily fix this, but eventually, Alexa quits working again. Otherwise, for the price, it's a great little tablet.",

4,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - Lasted all of 4 uses before I had problems! I purchased this product on a deal and at first left it in the box. I had a vacation coming up that I planned to use for watching movies on an upcoming trip a couple months later. I opened the device and set it up and the device worked flawlessly... for 4 whole uses! The device was used for initial set up, a drive up north, a drive back home, and a week later I downloaded a few apps because my phone had broke. That night I attempted charging the device and the device would state it was charging, however in the morning to my surprise it was now at only 10%. I restarted the device and tried another charger.  I checked the device an hour later and now it was at 7%. I reached out to Amazon and since I was out of warranty they would do nothing other than offer me 15% off a refurbished device.  I can say in the past I have owned other Kindles for my daughter. Every single one I have owned quickly has problems charging. Without a doubt I can say I will NEVER waste another dollar on a Kindle device. They have the same problem time and time again and Amazon does nothing to support it's customers in the replacement of a faulty device. This device was used by an adult and has not one flaw to the screen, charging port, etc. I am meticulous with my devices and always only use the original charger for them. I cannot recommend a device that after 4 uses will no longer charge - this device has a USB-C port so it is impossible to connect it improperly.  I will update this review when I receive my replacement cell phone to take pictures of my device and show how it was without flaw. I hope that this saves another customer $89 on a wasted device!",,,,

The screen has good colors and decent resolution for movie's and games. The cpu is just fast enough for games compared to my S20 Ultra. The battery so far seems to last a long time though I have not timed it I haven't ran out of power yet before charging it. I did install the Google Play store for more of a variety of apps. You need to go on the web for instructions on how to install the Google Play store. It's not hard to do. Just follow the instructions and install the apk files in the correct order and it will work fine. Believe me it's a must have. When you first power on the tablet wait for a few and let it boot up completely before you attempt any input. Once the boot up process is complete have fun. For the price you can't beat it compared to other low priced tablets. Just try it. You can always send it back if your not happy.,,,

0,,,,"Lighter and more features than my old one! My wife had one of the original Amazon Kindle Fire tablets. We enjoyed it for many years.  Mostly reading, but also some streaming, games, and internet.  The micro-usb port finally failed and we couldn't charge it without doing ""charging cable yoga.""This new unit has a few ups and downs: UPs: The device is much lighter and easier to hold than the old one.  The screen is bright and responsive.  It has lots of features for use as a tablet beyond just reading that allow it to compete with Samsung Tab and iPad. DOWNs: The battery does not seem to last as long in the new version.  This may help make it lighter, but for moderate use, you will need to charge daily (before, my wife plugged in the old one every few days). Ad-supported price.  We got this one for an incredible deal during Prime Day.  In the smaller print, the price is Ad-supported, so customer directed ads would appear on the lock screen.  Not too bad, but my wife didn't like, so we had to pay Amazon the $15 ransom to remove the ads. (on the up-side, the $15 is a one-time charge, not a subscription).We are currently having some trouble with a feature that alerts you if moisture has entered the charging port.  We keep getting the alert even if the fire tablet has not been near any liquid.  I have to do a little more research on that. it may have a defect.The last comment is that the swipe navigation is a little less intuitive to us than the old device.  we are still learning it, so sometimes it can be a little frustrating to get to the screen we want-just like my iPhone!",

Tried some potential fixes and finally turned off/on router and that seemed to do the trick. But a week later not connecting  again.

4,,,,,"Buyer Beware of Moisture Warning with USB Charging Port I am very concerned. After purchasing multiple Kindles over the last 10 years (I think I'm on #10), the last 3 have caused significant issues. Amazon completely replaced the one Kindle three years ago with a kiddie version. That seemed to work well until it didn't about 2 years later. So, last year (2021) I purchased a Fire HD 8. No problems until last week (week of July 18th). Now I have a ""moisture"" problem with the USB charging port. How that happened is a complete mystery. No liquid at all around the device. Perhaps the change from a humid environment to an air conditioned one.Watch out!!! Once this issue arises, there is nothing that can be done. I've followed the instructions to no avail. You can't charge the Fire HD. There is an irritating warning beep. The website warns that trying to continue to charge is dangerous with potential permanent damage. I've turned the stupid thing upside down (as instructed and as if that is the problem), shook it, let it sit for days, tried different cords, tried wiping it with a cloth, tried blowing it with a hair dryer, tried changing environments, tried looking up online. Absolutely nothing!Complaints online say this is a real issue which Amazon refuses to fix. The device is completely useless - refuses to charge. Now, what do I do? Call Amazon and complain? I don't have a lot of hope in Amazon and Kindle now. We have over 500 books we've bought over the years. Buyer beware!"
5,,Great deal Great deal on a fire tablet.,,,
6,,,"Understand This: Before you buy this device, understand: at some point, even when your software is updated, there will be issues. If you want to use this tablet to load with your Kindle ebooks, be careful about uploading too many at a time. That is the only reason I can figure so far a to why I can't remove a book from my device without completely deleting it from my ENTIRE library (i. e. If you wanted to save it for later you will have to buy it again.)Usually you have 2 options: Remove from device, and permanently delete. Some books Lev e me the option to simply remove from device, most of the ones on my Kindle Fire 8 DO NOT GIVE THAT OPTION.There is also the fact that where i used to be able to watch Netflix on these devices, I am not able to any more, or watch things on any video app with the exception of YouTube on the internet browser. No video apps will work. I can still watch Amazon Prime Video, but since I currently can't afford Prime this is only limited to those videos I have purchased.These problems are on both my Fire 8 and Fire 10, both of which are fully software updated.",,

Even after paying the money, the ads continue to appear.  It was also supposed to be lightening fast but it is not. Using the camera and examining the pics was poor quality.  I take a lot of pics of plants/nature on other devices and had no issues. I set the Screen Lock to five minutes but it locks after one minute.  I have to constantly log back in.

4,,,,,"Fire 8 does not live up to expectations My first tablet was a Nook and, because the Nook OS was so crippled, I determined I would get a Kindle next in response to rave reviews. Little did I realize that, shortly before my Nook died, Amazon declared war on Google and removed the Android OS that made the Kindle so user friendly! The settings menu is greatly lacking in control options. Every time I connect to the internet, my home screen is plastered with ads that I can't turn off. Kindle OS forces users to use the Silk Browser and the Amazon play store, and much like Nook OS, about half of all apps don't work. I can't even get the Kindle OS to use my VPN, which was rather critical to a functioning Kindle because I was living in China for four years after buying my Fire 8, and all of Amazon's online services are blocked by the Chinese National Firewall. As for the selections rated above: the screen visuals are crisp and clear, but the battery can't stand up to on-screen games (it drops at a charge rate of about 2% per minute while playing any on-screen games), and I find myself having to repeatedly touch, touch, touch, touch, retouch the screen to get any commands acknowledged while ingame. In short, Jeff Bezos' greed to take out Google destroyed the quality of this product. I strongly reccommend a Samsung or a Xiaomi tablet instead of this now inferior product."

2,,"Great for life on-the-go! Though I'm not traveling as much as I did in my previous job, I purchased the new Fire so I could read books more easily (instead of on my phone) , watch movies, and share those functions with my grandsons. I have a larger tablet for travel (instead of toting my laptop) but it's a bit heavy and sometimes I just want to relax under the covers and enjoy a movie or good book. With an inexpensive set of ear buds, this little workhorse gets lots of use. The grandkids enjoy the games, it's super-easy to download movies (for them or for me to enjoy when WiFi isn't available), and I enjoy listening to music and podcasts on this. A great buy for me. Don't know what this grandma would do without it!",,,

I can look up stuff when needed, do the occasional video, and read to my hearts content without feeling like I'm suffering through arm day at the gym.

0,,Awesome product. I love it. Love it.,,,
1,,,,"Curb your expectations and it might be worth it The fire tablet can do everything it claims to do, albeit very poorly. The specifications are atrocious. Web browsing experience is horrendous, the screen resolution is awful for image quality, the speakers pop in and out when receiving power making any audio and video unbearable, the amazon OS is bogged down with ads, and under any other circumstances I would never recommend this dumpster fire of a device to anyone looking for a standard android tablet experience.It is however, a very good reading device. Technically the main intended purpose of the fire tablets, and it does that job really well. Light weight, very long battery life, and thick bezels that let you grip on to it easily without constantly making inputs to the touch screen. Do yourself a favor and look up how to remove all the garbage amazon OS applications and load in google services. It's a fairly simple process and it does not void your warranty as you can easily factory reset at any time. I've been reading epubs and manga on it for a week now and its been very comfortable reading on the couch or in the bed compared to the laptop and phone I've been using previously.I picked it up at 45 dollars during prime sale which I think is a pretty solid steal. I think Amazon is selling these at-cost even on retail pricing so its hard to complain about the value, but I still have a hard to recommending it for 90 dollars. Wait for sales, more will happen.",

4,,,"You Get What You Pay For Full disclosure: this is not my first Fire Tablet. But it does have the same frustrating issues that the others had.I am normally an iPad/iPhone user. I usually keep a Fire Tablet at work for occasional use (reading on my lunch break mostly), but the experience is so frustrating I find myself preferring to read on my phone more often. So what are these issues?First, this device is so laggy. Oftentimes there is a noticeable delay between touching the screen and the device registering the touch. I guess it's not a huge deal but its really irritating when all you're trying to do is open a Kindle book or turn a page.Second, Fire OS is very prone to stuttering and dropping frames. The overall experience is pretty janky and reminds me of Android Marshmallow on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Amazon is trying to do too much with Fire OS; no one asked for all of the extra apps they slap on these devices. Email? Documents? Goodreads> Alexa? Why not ship these out vanilla and allow me to download them if I want? I just want an e-reader that also plays movies occasionally. Why do I need a News app? or iMDB TV? Why is there a Maps app? There's too much going on and the processors they use in these devices are not able to keep up with the demands the software places on them (in addition to being very un-secure, so DO NOT USE A FIRE TABLET FOR PERSONAL/WORK EMAIL).If you're looking for a cheap media consumption device, these are fine but janky and overstuffed with apps you can't delete. Go for it if you like, but know what you're getting.",,

9,,"It's a fabulous product, just... ...don't get one if you already own an iPad! Let me explain.Everything I can do on a Kindle Fire, I can do on my iPad better. Reading, streaming, e-mails, social media, games... literally everything. The OS on the Fire tablet is clunky in comparison. Even the virtual keyboard doesn't work as well for me.Oh, and with the Alexa enabled on the Fire, when I use it in the same room as an Echo (which is everywhere in my house), they don't work together very well. I'll say ""Alexa, display the weather on my Kindle Fire,"" my Echo briefly lights up, makes a low beep, and says nothing. The weather doesn't display on my Fire.Right now my Fire tablet is mounted as a display for showing me the time and weather, and I rarely pick it up anymore. It's essentially an Echo Show now. Maybe if I were going somewhere and was afraid my iPad would get stolen or damaged, I'd take it with me. But I have a Kindle Paperwhite too, and I'd rather have that stolen or damaged than my Fire.If you've never had an iPad and you want a solid tablet device, by all means save money and get a Fire tablet. But my iPads (I've had 3 so far) have totally spoiled me! I now read from my Kindle library on my iPad's Kindle app. It's much easier to use than reading on the Fire. The Fire's user interface is slow & clumsy. There's a reason the Kindle tablets are priced much lower than an iPad's. My sling bag feels much lighter without both my iPad and Fire since I started leaving my Fire at home every day.Sorry, Amazon! Quality over quantity every time.",,,

I like the feel of it when used for reading; besides Kindle, you can also use it for many other apps (almost like an iPad at a much lower price).I think there is some room for improvements. E.g. I can’t receive Skype calls when the tablet is locked (no setting option to fix this issue); some pre-install apps under the “child” profile can’t be removed/relocated (also, child account can’t receive Skype calls); the sound volume is not loud enough.Overall, it’s a pretty good value tablet.",
0,,,It rocks Great tablet kids love it and price is right,,
1,,It’s working great so far. Using “YouTube” to follow a Church based in Miami (I’m in Orlando).,,,
2,Disappointed Couldn't get it to connect. Kept timing out,,,,
3,,,,,Limited on app downloads We use inexpensive tablets to download apps such as Navionics in order to plot our boats courses thru saltwater channels and bays. Non of the Amazon Fire tablets will allow it. We understand this is not an Amazon app but wish they would make a deal together to allow it. Otherwise the Fire tablets aren’t much use to us.
4,,Easy It’s easy to learn and easy to use,,,
5,,Ok over all. Invest in good cover if buying Could use improved quality and installation of screen protector and little better battery run time.,,,

Instead, I got a big complicated tablet, which is almost like a computer.  Unfortunately, I was in the middle of selling my house and have moved and the return of this product got put on the back burner.Could you please exchange this for a Kindle Fire, even though it's past your 30-day return policy?Thank you, Katy Dolan",,,,
9,,,,,"Randomly turns off Bought this for my 2 year old and he dislikes it passionately. The screen randomly turns off and he’s forced to ask one of us to unlock the device so he can resume his activities. Having to enter the pin every 10 seconds is SUPER annoying. Also, the ads are not always child friendly."
0,,"Great alternative to Apple I’ve wanted to get an iPad mini for years, but the cost is a bit absurd. Saw this as a half price Prime Day deal and couldn’t pass it up!

5,,,,"Upgrading from Fire 7 difficult I thought I would just be able to pop my Sd card from my fire 7 and my music would all be there. Nope. C'mon Amazon, why make that so hard. When I put my old sd card in it wanted to reformat the card, which I assumed would wipe all data. I read another review that said the apps would be lost but the data would be OK. I backed up the sd card just in case, and guess what, yep it was wiped clean. Why do you do this Amazon? It wasn't just the music, I wanted the playlist too. I spent days getting everything back the way I wanted.The Fire 8 HD is much faster than the old Fire 7, mostly I think because the old Fire only had 8G of internal storage. It had become quite slow and quirky. It might download a library book, and might not. It would take 2 or 3 minutes to start up. Opening a book might take anothe 2 or 3 minutes. It would lose books. The fire 8 cured all that, but changing from one to the other should have been easier.",
6,,,,,"The OS is crap Has severely limited app options unless you install APKs from the Internet to get the play store. Very limited usability without being able to download ANY Google apps, like Gmail or chrome.If you just want it for TV and Kindle it's great. Literally anything else and it's useless out of the box."
7,,,"Purchased to monitor BLINK camera Your BLINK home monitor app does not appear in Amazon's appstore, so you won't be able to monitor your Blink cameras. I'm keeping for a few days to see if Amazon puts out a system update, otherwise, back it goes.UPDATE: The BLINK app is now available in the appstore. I raised the rating from 1 to 3 stars. Since I won't be using most of the tablet's features, I won't comment on those. I will say compared to my Android tablet, this one's display is bad. Whites are yellow, even at 100% brightness. I miss double-tap to sleep/wake. Sometimes the right button to switch apps just doesn't work--a touch issue?However, the alerting of the BLINK monitor app is terrible. Next to my Android tablet, the Fire alerts to motion minutes after the Android, and sometimes does not send an alert at all if in sleep mode. I've checked and re-checked all of the settings and tested this several times. Not sure, even at the Prime Day price, if it's worth keeping.",,

That doesn’t bother me much since I only got this for e reading. There are adds every time you click the Home Screen button. It was really easy to set up. It came charged right out of the box.

My Nexus 7 is now relegated as a dedicated Torque device for my tool box - so no more frustrating major lag because of an ancient (but loved) little tablet.I got the HD8 because of it's light weight and screen size - so far it's great. If I want more power I'll switch to my heavier TAB S5e (10.1"")  or the desktop. But night time reading is no longer frustrating - very responsive and excellent display. Love it so far!I'll update after a couple of months",,,

That is, I am disappointed that I can't simply connect the Kindle to my PC and access folders (i.e., music, photos, books, etc.) and, especially, the added SD card.  If I want to have my own music, videos, etc., on the SD card, I have to remove it from the Kindle and put the SD card into my PC and copy files from the PC directly on to the SD card.

0,,,,,"Only buy when on sale. I have a kindle fire hd 8 (7th edition) it's to the point where I can only download one book at a time before it closes out the library & goes to the home screen. It does then when downloading, removing a book from device, archiving a book and takes forever for me to get back to my library of books. I can't listen to a book while another downloads either. I don't really have a problem with the internet speed just the functionality of the device when obtaining and/or listening to a book. So I decided to get an updated kindle fire hd 8 (10th edition/2020 release). It's smaller, lighter, and comes in different colors and that's about all that's good with it. The new one glitches when unlocking the kindle, slower response time, and the internet surfing is much slower. It took a while for me to just get Google up. Glad it was about 50% off. Oh and thus far with the new kindle I can download multiple books and not one at a time. The box came delivered damaged so hope that didn't effect the quality or something."

Sometimes use it to peruse the interweb to answer questions my kids ask.  Love the way it tracks my whole Kindle library from previous devices and I can still pick up a book where I left off on my Phone if the kindle isn't near by.  The Kindle app has improved over the years and I enjoy the fact that book series are now collected and ordered by number in the series.  You can now tell if you are reading book 3 in the series before book 1!  I have learned from prior Kindles to not get a folding case.  That just doubles the weight and only provides minimal additional protection to the already durable Kindle.  The only drawback I had was that it becomes difficult (for my 70-year-old hands) to hold the kindle for hours while reading.  The solution was to put one of those pop-up phone holders on the back of the device.  I would have accepted the Kindle with slightly wider body if there were sculpted ridges to help hold the device in one hand.,,,

I wouldn’t have upgraded to the bigger screen if I wasn’t so pleased with the 8’” tablet.I would appreciate if Amazon made it easier to connect with Google programs. I use GMail and suppose I can use the Silk browser but would appreciate using apps like Duck Duck Go. I dislike every part of my life commodified and miss Proton mail, also designed for privacy. I’ve been using the Silk browser but feel it isn’t competitive to other browsers if it is what Amazon expects us to use.Beyond that, the 8” Fire Tablet has done a great job. I’d recommend it to any user, particularly Amazon Prime as it’s so seamless. I remember when tablets first came out, I go back to the third iPad which I’ve updated every few years. But if all I was doing was watching videos, playing games (and here these tablets show their inexpensive cost) with less definition, slower refresh rates, and so on.It is nice that memory can be updated with inexpensive SIM cards. I’m not sure what the limitation is on SIM card size but they can’t easily be removed and are reasonably priced. A 128 gb card I use in one of my instruments cost ~$20. For smaller ram the prices are considerably less expensive.For what it is the Fire Tablet this a bargain although I don’t think it would be good for office work which is often the complaints you’ll see which I think are unjustified. This is a really nice device for people to use for everyday use.",,,
2,,,"Not an IPad This is fairly nice product I guess.  My negativity stems from the fact that I'm used to Apple products, I have an IPhone and my wife has an IPad, and this tablet is awkward and just not on the same level in my opinion.",,
3,,Exceeds expectations I love it,,,
4,,Runs smoothly Love the overall quality,,,
5,,Instructions Once I figured out how to set it up I enjoyed the Kindle the most!Instructions are not very good at helping to find what you want on your fire tablet!,,,

7,,Efficient and convenient! Great to purchase as a gift for someone!,,,
8,,A very inexpensive tablet The price was very good.  The HD8 is bigger and better than the HD7 and only a bit more expensive.  It has better battery life too.  I like it for reading Kindle or ePub books that I can get from my digital library.,,,

6,,,,works well good value,
7,,"Replacement for an older tablet My old Fire HD 8 tablet had gotten to the point where the battery only held enough charge for 4 hours.  And I'd gotten a notification from Amazon that said it was too old to still receive security updates. So when there was a good sale, I picked up the latest version. Battery holds a great charge, and I have easy access to all my Kindle ebooks, Comixology comic books, Audible audiobooks, and Prime Video streaming movies. Adding an additional memory card was extremely easy. Happy with all the content options through Amazon and how accessable it is on a Fire tablet, so I will keep updating to a newer version about every 5 years.",,,
8,,,,,"Good Luck I have an older version of the fire and I sincerely hope that this version is better but I have my doubts since I had the same problems with the last two fire tablets that I purchased. Both of them started getting very glitchy after a couple of years. Both prohibited me from listening to DOWNLOADED music and watching DOWNLOADED videos while I had the fire on airplane mode. I bought the fire as a cheap means of amusing myself on long flights and it crapped out on me AGAIN. Part of the problem is the really horrible, glitchy apps that amazon foists on you. I'm biting the bullet and buying a real tablet. It's definitely more expensive, but twice burned I know that you get what you pay for."
9,"Big downgrade I had an earlier version of this and it was far superior to this one. I have had this for close to a year now. I only use it to listen to spotify podcasts while I work. The graphics are noticeably worse than my last one. If I pause a spotify podcast, this crap tablet will only play for 15 min. at a time after that, if it will play at all. Sometimes it goes blank too. This has been going on since I received the tablet. It does NOT happen on any of my other devices. I read somewhere that Amazon has a packet of code purposely crashing Spotify on fire tablets. If this is true, it should be fixed asap as it seems quite illegal, possible antitrust.",,,,
0,,Best gift idea Gave to husband for father's day and he absolutely loves it..says it's way faster than the fire 7 . VERY glad I upgraded. And if your worried about the ads version ..Dont..it only on the lock screen its not intrusive on what your doing at all ..so the savings is worth it.,,,
1,You're asking the wrong person How do you rate a product you've already had to replace. I guess they don't last more than two years.  It just died and was not worth fixing.,,,,
2,,Nice for a small one. Small and easy to use.,,,
3,,,,"Great tablet for the Amazon ecosystem, but... These tablets are great for a family trying to save some money, but after a few years of purchasing them (Four 7 inch, two 8, and one 10 in') I can tell you they do not last, software wise. Hardware, we took care of them and they all seem to function well except one. The 7's are already out of security support cycle, one of them won't turn on. The 8's are holding up well, but soon they will no longer be eligible for security updates either and I'm typing this on my 10. At one point you could side-load Google Play and a plethora of useful apps, but that no longer seems to be the case. At least not without some serious effort. my point; these are severely temporary. Investing into a longer supported ecosystem like Apple or Samsung seems to be the best option for my family.  Ill spend a little more to get a longer use cycle. for now they are just for watching prime and netflix and mine the ""10"" is just a convenient cash register for Amazon purchases. Amazon could be better in this space, but I understand the market and its most likely cost prohibited to keep these devices up to date security wise.",
4,"Turns off for no reason! I'm very dissatisfied with this tablet! It will shut off for no reason ""battery is charged"" and the only way to get it to turn back on is by plugging the charger into it. The power button won't turn it on. Trying to restart it won't work. Only plugging the charger in. And the funny thing is I haven't even had it for a month and there's no return or exchange option on my Amazon for a knew one. Bought it for my sons birthday. Waste of money!!!",,,,
5,,Just what I wanted I had a kindle fire several years ago. It got misplaced in a move. I decided to get a Kindle Paper white since I mostly use it for reading. I was sooooo disappointed! The color and quality of this Fire HD 8 is definitely worth it! Very pleased with my purchase!,,,
6,,"Great cheap tablet for my 4yo... My MIL purchased this black tablet for my 4yo on QVC/HSN.  He uses it to watch videos on Netflix, and just started getting interested in YouTube. But he has plenty of games (ex: color by number, hot wheels racing, some educational games, galaxia, bingo, uno) some ""purchased"" (aka free games only for us) through the app store, some through the kids app when the tablet is in kid mode. Battery lasts long as I keep it in airplane mode as soon as they get distracted and run off to play with some toys.  I suggest all kids use this tablet, it's cheap and totally useful as they get older. The best part is the memory card expander cardslot. It can go from 32/64GB to 1TB if you needed more or less if necessary. Can't do that on the competition, just saying! And if your tech savvy enough, you can make this tablet a full on android and access the Playstore and get even more use out of it.",,,

I use my kindle primarily for reading, and I either have been using my child’s outdated fire, that took forever to charge, or using the app from my phone or iPad, but both are uncomfortable, or I end up on social media- or Amazon, instead of reading!  While I still use my phone some, I am so happy that I upgraded my kindle to this one. It’s the perfect size, charges fast (with original charger) and the screen is great for reading outside.",,,

7,"Damn thing lasted 2 months and died. I received delivery on my new Kindle Fire HD8 on 05/05 2022. I use it exclusively for downloading and reading books. A normal day would include reading in bed for 15-20 minutes, getting up and plugging it into the charger while preparing my morning coffee, reading for 30-60 minutes, plugging it back into the charger for an hour or two, reading for another hour or two through out the day, and then repeating. When I unplugged it from the charger this morning it failed to come on. I tried pressing the on-off button, nothing. I've had it on the charger for four hours now, still nothing. I'm dreading trying to contact Amazon. If past experience is any indicator, they do everything in their power to avoid communicating with their customers.",,,,

I quickly bought a replacement as I used it every day to read e-books, email and browse the internet with my downloaded version of Google. I never use Amazon's Silk browser. The new device came and it was easy to recover my library and gmail accounts. It is now next to impossible to download the Google Playstore or Google Chrome, though. All the online information to install on Fire is from 5 years ago and current techie directions are more complex than I care to attempt. Why can't all these corporations get along? Why so greedy!! I am very unhappy with the mentality that led to this updated version of frustration.",,

3,,"The Best Little Tablet I've Ever Owned The screen quality is fantastic in terms of both image sharpness and responsiveness to input. The battery life is respectably long even during performance of energy-intensive tasks. The camera takes both high-quality photographs and videos. The look and feel of the device are also classy and sleek.When you first begin using the tablet, it will require the installation of a new OS and at least 20 updates, but the updates can be installed in the background. To get the most out of your tablet, you'll also want to enable installation of third-party apps so you can install the Google Play Store on the device (you can Google the procedure for this) and acquire the Google Apps you use on your Android device (the Amazon Appstore is very limited). Following this, you will have a versatile tablet that doubles up as an Android device and Kindle reader.The only thing about this tablet that bothers me slightly is Autocorrect, as it does not work very well and offers the suggestions that are sometimes downright ridiculous. Still it is not enough to detract all that much from the overall experience.In sum, this is a fantastic tablet that I am proud to welcome into my electronic family. It is beautiful to handle and to behold. It offers a wide range of versatility once you open it up to the Google Play Store. It is also just fun to use in general for a wide range of applications.

3,,,,,"Garbage While a Fire tablet may seem like a good deal, most of the apps and functions you are accustomed to using on your smartphone just don’t work. Instead of YouTube and chrome, you can get kludgy emulators. Search for an answer online? Get a link YouTube video in a foreign language. Want to mark the link as not helpful, no option. Want to connect to Bluetooth? Get an incorrect pin or pass key error without ever inputting one. After owning this one for several months, I think a piece of paper would be more useful."

However, I am disappointed that the cover I used with my broken Kindle is not the correct size for my newest one.

I'm highly disappointed.,,,,
0,"Bad battery Purchased this during a prime sale to give to my daughter for Christmas. Put it away and gave it to her 6 months later. Unfortunately this Fire HD8 has a problem acknowledging its charge. So even if the device is at 90% it may choose not to wake up. If you connect it to power, it turns on immediately and shows the charge and then continues to work for a while until the charge again isn't acknowledged (every couple of days). Unfortunately for us, since I put the Fire away as a Christmas present this problem was not discovered until after the 90 day warrantee period (the one I bought for the other daughter in November, of course had no problems). However, they would be glad to trade it in and sell me a new one! I have always appreciated Amazon customer service in the past. Sad that bad customer service comes with one of their own items.",,,,

7,,,,"Be Aware of What it Is It's not an iPad.  It's not a Samsung tablet.  It has some inherent limitations, but for the price, it ain't bad.The Kindle Fire HD is a tablet.  It was designed to be an entry point into Amazon-world, and it is optimized for shopping, games and entertainment (streaming).  But it can do a lot more as long as the user understands its limitations.The biggest limitation is that it is connectable ONLY via Wifi, so anything that you want to do that requires an interface to the Internet requires that you be within range of an accessible Wifi hub.  That mean you can't web-surf or stream a video at a campsite in the woods.  But it's just as responsive on our home Wifi as my wife's iPad or my iPhone.The Kindle Fire uses Amazon's proprietary version of the Android operating system, so its basic functionality will be familiar if you are accustomed to an Android phone.  However, it also means that the normal channel for obtaining apps is via the Amazon app store.  Like Google Play and the Apple App store, the selection of apps is pretty extensive.  However, the Amazon collection is limited in some areas - eg, the on-line apps for many local banks aren't available.While it is not possible to download apps from Google Play to the Kindle Fire directly out of the box, there is a way to augment the basic offering so that apps can be retrieved from Google.  Do a Google search for installing the Google Play Store on a Kindle Fire - note that the instructions are a little involved and must be followed carefully.There are a number of basic apps included on the device - none of which can be removed.  Some are simply other versions of more familiar apps.  For example, the native browser is Silk - seemingly different from Firefox or Google, but with much the same functionality.  Likewise, the native map app is actually Here - which is highly respected in many countries outside North America.  After devoting a little 'play time' to these, I found that they are quite usable.  Apps that you don't need/want can be clustered in an 'Unused App' folder so that they don't clutter up the screen.  E-mail works well.The price is very attractive, and I was surprised at the apparent build quality - to my mind, it compares very favorably with an iPad.  Only time will tell how it holds up.  The screen is bright.  Sound is ok but if you want higher quality audio, I suspect that you could use the built-in Bluetooth to link to an external audio system.",

0,"Fire HD Tablet 8"" I purchased a Fire HD 8 on May 8, 2022 and received it the next day. In a little over one month, the tablet would not turn on after it was fully charged. Called Amazon and they agreed to replace my Fire with a brand new one. I was very clear that I purchased new, so I wanted the replacement to also be brand new. I took my fire to UPS on 06/18/22, and the replacement Fire was received today (06/19/22). Well this was not even in an orange box like the brand new one I previously purchased. I went back into my account and noticed a ""R"" after the description of the one I received today, which makes be believe they sent me a refurbished Fire. I called Amazon immediately and informed them I will not even take this out of the plastic cover because it was not in a box, it was simply in a large shipping box. It appears this was repackaged and sent to me probably from someone else's returned item. Additionally, there were no instructions in this box. The first Fire I received included  instructions and it was nicely packaged in an orange box. See the picture I attached. This will be sent back to Amazon in the morning. Although, I am very disappointed with the item I received, Amazon customer service is great.",,,,
1,,Great product Really good product,,,
2,Limited Google compatibility I am not impressed with the Amazon android (old android OS version copy) ecosystem as opposed to a real Android tablet.

I also wanted a larger screen and a device with more on-board memory and storage.I love the larger screen and I love that its charger is USB-C. That makes it both easy to see and easy and fast to charge. The battery lasts a nice long time. I keep it on when I'm not using it because it's easier (see below) and it needs charging about every two to three days when it's idle. And when I do charge it, it doesn't run down below the 80s.My only complaints are that I thought it would be a bit faster, in terms of processing speed, and that it has a startup sound that you have to use a workaround to stop. It seems a little sluggish when resolving webpages and playing videos. But I bought it for books and for that it works flawlessly. The startup sound is awkward at night when I'm trying to be quiet. Why include a device startup sound that can't be turned off in the settings? That is just poor design. I had to use a fix I found on Reddit (search ""Turning off the startup sound on the Fire HD guide Reddit"" and you'll find the instructions) to get the sound to turn off, but it has to be done every time. That's just a really big flaw, Amazon.Aside from those two things, I'm happy with my purchase.",

7,"DO NOT BUY! I arrived home at 8:15 p.m. to find my new Fire 8 HD tablet waiting. I couldn't wait to open it and fire it up.By 8:45 p.m. it was back in the box and I had already submitted a request to return it. It's incomprehensible and impossible to use. There's no way to get out of whatever app it started automatically after I finished the setup. And the setup process tricked me into signing up for Kindle Unlimited, which I DON'T want.I can't recommend the Fire 8 HD to anyone. Do yourself a favor and just buy a Samsung Android tablet. You'll be much better off. The Fire is brain dead.",,,,

I have only gotten new versions because of a nice exchange/upgrade program...not because the tabs went bad or anything. Hope you enjoy yours.",,,
4,"Won't charge Bought this less than a year ago and now it will not charge.  I guess if you buy  this you better get the extended warranty because this is useless to me now after very little use.

Keep up the good work Amazon!",,,

I needed some thing to which I could upload all of my old Nook e-books,, and Kindle offers that much more for a comparable price.

The Kindle offers me much more connectivity, and allows me to take my streaming with me.",

7,,,,"Getting a bit put off For the most part, I have been very happy with my HD8 tablet.  Lately, not so much.  I have had it for a couple of years now and although the performance meets all of my needs and expectations I have had a few problems with it in the time I have owned it.For the second time in about 6 months or so I have had to do a hard factory reset causing me to lose all of the downloaded apps (including the side-loaded Google Play apps) that I had downloaded.  This takes me about an hour or so to reload everything if I can even remember what was there to begin with.The first reset was due to the tablet completely freezing up.  It took a soft reset so that I could get back into the settings.  If I selected any app it would appear to load the app and then freeze.  After several soft resets I finally had to do the factory reset.  This has happened twice in the past year.This morning everything was fine.  The tablet had a full charge.  I read the news at breakfast and had it on and off for the next hour or so with no problems.  At lunch I woke it back up and the screen had an orange tint.  Everything worked as it should but there was no way to get the full screen color spectrum back.  I tried all of the suggestions from Google searches and once again had to resort to a hard reset.  It is back up and seems to be working fine with good color, but now I have to load everything back in.One more problem and it will get replaced with a Samsung or Lenovo tablet.  The affordable price isn't affordable if I continue to have problems and have to replace it every year or so along with the frustration of having to restore all the apps each time it has to be reset.",

3,,"Best tablet for the price! I am in love with this tablet, I prefer this over my Samsung Galaxy. I did a lot of shopping around and couldn't find another quality tablet for the price. The battery life is much better than expected and it doesn't take long to charge. I love the size and portability. I use this tablet for reading mostly but i also use it for banking, shopping, notes, photos, video calls, and watching movies. It doesn't take amazing quality pictures but it does good enough. I also love the options it has if you want to use it as a smart home remote or other amazon features. The speakers could be better but If you want to stream movies or make video calls I would suggest getting an Amazon Tablet with better speakers. I'm not picky, for the price the speakers don't bother me. I would recommend getting the Amazon case designed for this tablet if it's going to be used by an adult, it goes into sleep mode when the cover is closed which makes a difference on battery life. If you are buying this for a kid I would go with a kid case instead of the Amazon case to give it more protection.",,,

0,,"Love My New Tablet w/More Storage Space ... I am 83 & a Voracious Reader ... I have been my whole life ... I HAVE to read every day ... sometimes more than one book ... My daughter had been trying to convince me for years to get a Kindle because of my love of Reading ... But I always thought I would just hate it because not the same as real books (Love the Smell, the way they feel, look - everything about them - & always will) ... my son found a deal on a small one a few years ago & got it for me ... I reluctantly started using it & my daughter told me ways to get Books for Free &/or really good deals on books from my favorite authors or genres (BookBub & EarlyBird I think - she tracks them for me - otherwise I would wind up getting every deal that popped up) ... I filled it up in no time & it just recently died on me ... My daughter assured me ALL my books were not lost (she tried explaining about them being in clouds but I don't do computers) ... She helped me pick out a replacement Kindle Fire & suggested I get one with more storage because I already own hundreds of books ... I liked this one - plus it came in a pretty color ... When I received it my daughter easily walked me through ""restoring"" ALL of my Books & things that I had before on my old tablet onto my New tablet ... Once this was done I was pleased with how much faster I could download new books & with how much more storage I still have available (I had to delete books off my old one if I wanted a new one) ... She showed me how I can turn it long ways (like a wide-screen tv) & helped me adjust my font & brightness - so now Reading is even more enjoyable than ever ... I also got the 3 year accident protection (just in case - I am 83 after all) ...I Highly recommend this Kindle Fire to everyone ... including stubborn old timers like me ... If you don't have someone to help you set it up (like my daughter) - that's OK too because Amazon has Wonderful Customer Service & they will be happy to help you set it up at no extra charge (they can even take control of your screen to help fix things - But Only if You give them permission - they have helped me several times this way) ... So if your not sure about these things - But Love to read as much as I do ... I say ""For the Love of Reading Take the Chance"" ... I think you'll find yourself as pleasantly surprised as I have been (I can take a whole book series with me in one hand ... WooHoo!) ...PS ... I still read physical books too ... Never Too Many Books! ... Just Not Enough Time! ...",,,

You can't change what is Homescreen...It's trash! I use it as a paper weight now. Do not buy this unless you want to see ads when you log on and when you try to swipe on your screen to get another app. It just go to ads....Awful device. I will never buy another one again!

I compare this generation with my two previous and much older tablets. The older generation tablets( which I still use ) are basically flawless. I realize that these tablets are inexpensive, therefore, do not expect perfection. I did hope the newer generation would offer me an even better experience, however, I have not experienced this. I will say that battery life is much better on the new tablet. The control tabs are smaller and placed differently with the power button right beside the volume up button so  I accidently turn the tablet off when meaning to turn up the volume. I will admit that , for the money, you won't get a better tablet as it is a good deal.",,
3,,,,"What a Buy ! My Fire does apps, internet, email just like my laptop computer and my wife's iPad. The only difference is the price: 5-10% of the two mentioned. What a buy. I got mine originally to replace my Kindle; what a surprise.",
4,"A waste of money I've had this for a few months now. In my opinion, this is a very cheap solution that is designed to last and to function proportional with the price. I should have spent more on an ipad. This piece of crap doesn't work all the time, Alexa is also lagging in responding, all in all a waste of money",,,,
5,,This an awesome tablet I take it everywhere I haven't found anything I don't like about it battery life last for hours screen is awesome,,,
6,,,,,"Cheap but should be even cheaper Poor performance, fingers don’t glide well over the glass display, notification sounds come out tinny, display color balance is pretty bad, bezels are huge, some of my books don’t work on this but work on iPad, iPhone and an e-Ink Kindle.This device ended up costing me a little over $100 after removing ads. The price with ads is even too high in my opinion. This tablet is worth no more than $40 in my opinion. It’s like something you’d win from a claw machine at a rest stop."

YouTube: type 'rolling asmr wood'.I bought this to keep my daughter entertained while I'm doing chores etc in the house.  This was before she can stand or sit. I didn't want to keep giving her my phone since I was using it to find work. I needed to redo my resume, apply for gigs/jobs, and search.I couldn't do that at first since she was on the phone watching baby YouTube videos.Now that I have it I can actually do stuff while she's preoccupied.  I don't have to worry about her trying to change my wallpaper or settings anymore, lol!",,,
9,,,,An essential tool as expected I have had a number of fire tablets. Different size and capacities and generally very happy. There are some things  it just can accomplish so I focus on what it can do well.My only disappointment was I ordered twighlight blue to distinguish it from my other tablets that are maxed out in memory but still useful for games and viewing photos and reading ebooks already downloaded.  So when I saw it was black I was disappointed  but the color doesn't alter it's functionality.  I was so happy to get it that I didn't notice the color until I had already set it up with my personal info. If I had seen the color I probably  would have returned it for the right color.,

I have over a hundred books that are waiting to be read!  I highly recommend this!",,,
5,,,"Loses wifi I have had an Amazon Fire Kindle for a long time.  It periodically loses wifi which results in me losing stored books that then have to be restored.  The only way to resolve it is to shut it off and turn it back on which loses even more stored books.  In looking for a solution, I found that Amazon uses Inferior products.  Seems cheesy to me.",,

0,,Great new tablet My old Kindle was starting to have some issues after several years and I upgraded to this and am completely satisfied with the upgrade. Works great and no technical issues. I was having some trouble with initial setup and I thought maybe the device was defective but the issue ended being that my wifi connection was too weak or slow so I setup up at another location that had faster stronger connection speeds and that was it.,,,
1,,,,"It’s fine for a kids tablet Compared to iPads, the technology in these is really nowhere close—that said, you’re also paying a fraction of the price, so it still has a use case. I find that this tablet often has a difficult time processing (probably due to the INSANE amount of crappy bloatware filling this thing), so it stutters and freezes up pretty often. We bought it to play movies for my daughter during longer car rides, and for that it’s been pretty great. We also have a few learning games on it that she enjoys.  The image quality is also pretty decent.Don’t expect too much of this tablet and you won’t be disappointed.",

0,,"Great improvements from the previous Fire HD 8 What like about this Fire HD 8 is that it is a worthy upgrade from the previous model as the extra memory helps avoid the previous woes of applications randomly crashing from running out of memory and some uses you do notice the extra snappiness of the faster processor speed compared to the previous Fire HD 8 too. From a processor speed & much needed memory, I will note it does bring the Fire HD 8 back to a more competitive tablet on the budget side than it was previously.  If you switch between multiple applications often, the Fire HD 8 Plus might be a better choice with 3GB of memory.  As far as battery life experience, at 50% brightness I was able to get a bit over 8.5hrs of run time vs the previous Fire HD 8 which typically ran for 7 hrs.Pros:-This generation of Fire HD 8 using USB-C adds more reliability in charging, my previous micro-USB Fire HD 8 slowly developed a loose charger port so this is a major improvement & reason to consider this model.-Using a 3rd party rapid charger will charge this tablet faster.-Touchscreen seems more sensitive when using a stylus compared to the previous Fire HD 8.-Brightness appears to be more even without light bleed from the corners like my previous Fire HD 8.-Audio sounds crisper at 50% volume and seems like Amazon tweaked the speakers.-Smaller case borders on the width and height have made it smaller so you'll need a new case, Fire HD 8 still has a nice weight balance.",,,
1,,,,,Not the best No google play store — quality isn’t the best — one broke instantly not even sure how…
2,,,,"Works as expected with exceptions. The tablet frequently shuts off on its own. I have the screen sleep mode turned off. I have to plug it into the charger to get it to come on. Other than that, it works great, and the battery will last at least 24 hrs. if all I do is read books with it.",
3,,,"Randomly shuts off I had an old fire that I really liked so when it finally died I wanted to replace it with another fire. This one does good for the most part, but it has a sensor on the front that shuts off the screen if a shadow crosses over it.  The biggest issue is that even when that sensor isn't covered the whole kindle will shut down and not turn back on unless its plugged in even if the battery is completely charged.",,
4,,Perfect for travel I bought this specifically to make long plane rides for work more tolerable. It works great for connecting to the plane wifi and watching movies or just reading my books. I did buy a cover for it to protect the screen. So far no issues and great price for what I needed.,,,

I found out about the issues this week, and Amazon tells me they won't replace it because the limited warranty has expired.  But, I can get a 20% trade-in allowance on a new device!.

Downside the device doesn't support Fresh big let downI did purchase some smart outlets and the set up was easy and I'm looking at cameras so the device itself has great valueThe app store kinda sucks but you'll deal, side loading Google apps and apks is almost impossible.Nice thing is it fits on my sun visor so sometimes when I'm killing time in the car it makes a perfect time killer",

Even tho it's a bit more difficult to carry with one hand, I like the increased size screen because there are more words per screen than with my former tablet, so I don't have to swipe to the next page as often.  I also love the increased battery life.  I can go almost three days without having to charge it, and I'm on it an average of 6-7 hours a day.  The price for the tablet was very reasonable, too.

Amazon is using a different dictionary than I am chatting needs to have an exchange of words not select a topic pull down window that never has your problem or question preselected for their convenience. What made matters worse there was a window on the chat page that said click here to call customer service I did, it called and said all reps are busy call back, on the phone it says try our cus.svs. chat, how about amazon trying hiring more people for cus. svs. My wife ordered the tab on the 14th fri. she has prime it could be sent by prime it was supposed to be here sat. 15th. it got here today the 18th.

I only use the device as an e-reader. It seemed nice at first because it had more brightness settings and the main screen was in color, however it has started to randomly ""shutoff"" while reading - forcing me to login again.....only to shut down again in a few minutes.Since it's ""out of warranty and support"" I searched for solutions. The only two indicated are RAM issues (I had purchased the upgrade to 64 GB !) or battery life. re-booted it repeatedly and the same thing happens. My original Kindle had the same battery for 13 years - and this one only lasted 8 months - you have to be kidding me ! The machine says it's charged but apparently it's not.

Amazon won’t stand behind their product; said it only had a 3 month warranty (most Amazon devices are one YEAR). Won’t buy another at twice the price with only a 3 month warranty. Back to iPad.,,,,
7,,Perfect gift for a reader! This was a gift for a family member that loves to read.  The perfect gift!,,,
8,,Buy it again Okay it’s good but some apps u can’t get and the model is a 2021 but it is really good,,,
9,,Glad I purchased this! So far so good! Ive had the same kindle for 7 years so it was time for an upgrade. I love the color. And I have no problems so far.,,,
0,,Ok It's alright,,,
1,,,,,Dissatisfied A little dissatisfied. I have had to wipe the memory twice because for no reason the screen will go to an android menu where I cannot access anything. The first time it happened was the day after I bought it.

6,,"Great value Easy to use, long battery life!",,,
7,,,,"Good but Amazon too Restrictive To read Nook books on here took some looking across the internet to get Google Play up and running.  Come on Amazon, pretend we have a life outside your world.  Otherwise, the device works very well.  Wish we could have gotten the paper white version to access the Nook app (you can’t, BTW).",
8,,,,Great product! Completely satisfied!,
9,,,,Small enough to put in your purse- large enough for easy reading. Purchase this item for easy carrying on my trip to Italy,
0,,,Laggy It does the job its justSLOW,,
1,,,Can’t do audio books unless you have wifi I upgraded to this from the first generation Kendall touch device. I was so excited to have some thing that has a longer battery life than an hour. Today I noticed the audiobook I have downloaded at least five times has disappeared yet again. I don’t like that if I don’t have Wi-Fi things I have downloaded and show or physically located on my device get deleted unless I am actively using it. Sometimes I will be in the middle of reading a book and the book disappears even though I purchased it with money and it was download it on my Kindle. I will not be buying any more audiobooks since this Kindle device will not use audio book features unless you have Wi-Fi. I really wish that I had not gotten the audio for the book i am currently reading so that I could use the auto read feature. I may have to dig out my old generation one device so I can bypass the audiobook since the newer devices are ONLY able to play audiobooks AFTER you download them but MUST HAVE wifi. Stupid feature prevents me from giving five stars. If Amazon can get their crap together and fix it so that I can listen to my audiobooks (that are downloaded on the device) off Wi-Fi I would consider five star rating.,,
2,,"No customer support I had a 7"" 2013 model for 7 years. I bought this one April 2021 with great discounts. After 6 months the touch screen got harder to use, very slow, shuts down in the middle of watching shows and won't turn on unless I plug it into the charging cord. This happens even with a full battery. Obviously I got a dud. Amazon won't help me at all,  I have no choice but to lay out another $100 to buy one. Not impressed at all with Amazon's customer support.",,,
3,,It works awesome for what I bought it for! I love it. I got this tablet to use for myself and my 7 yr old son to play games and watch Netflix on. I love that the kid's profile is easy to set up and I love the screen time limits and other parent limits you can set up on it.,,,
4,,Tablet Amazon 8 HD Muy buen equipo Calidad Precio.,,,
5,,,,,How to retrieve apps from my kindle fire Harder to navigate than my kindle fire. Not able to get games from my old kindle.
6,,Fire HD 8 Tablet The screen size & touch screen capability are great. Battery life is perfect for the amount of use it gets in our day. We use it in our classroom for my preschoolers. It was their parents gift cards that allowed this purchase so why not share it. Teacher appreciation gift cards were amazing. I have installed some educational games for them to work with and they can watch videos during calm down time when needed.,,,
7,,Great Kindle This is my favorite go to device!,,,
8,,Very good quality. Very good product. Works good and battery last long!,,,
9,Poor quality purchase Worked fine for the first 2 months and suddenly the touch screen stops working out of the blue! Even tried a factory reset but nothing worked. Extremely disappointed!,,,,
0,,Wish it came with a stand Love my tablet but it needs a charging dock like the old one,,,
1,,,,,"Frustrating Garbage This is the most unreliable tablet I've ever owned. Constantly flakes out or doesn't respond to input. I've opened the browser with no other apps open, just to play a backing track on YouTube to practice guitar, and the app crashes repeatedly and has to restart. I can't use the internal mic to enter a search word, even though I've allowed the browser to access the mic. Flakes out of home mode all the time. If I tap for a headline to no longer show, it shows up anyway. Just a few fun examples."
2,,"It is easy to handle I like the clarlty. Use to download my books, check weather, emails, etc",,,
3,,Such a great value I got this to replace a 2016 model. Not much to say but that the value of these HD 8's is fantastic. I use mine specifically for watching YouTube videos and such while laying in bed.,,,
4,,,"Cheap and decent, but feels like it should pay me for how many ads there are I knew what I was getting: an inexpensive tablet with a decent screen that I can read on. It's exactly what I was looking for but I've never seen a device more loaded down with advertising. The built in apps are all pretty terrible and there isn't a good way to get alternatives installed. The browser, in particular, leaves something to be desired and everything reminds you of things you can spend money on through Amazon. I'm pretty integrated with the Amazon brand just because prime is so convenient but despite getting exactly what I'm looking for in terms of a product, it's a little unsettling how much I feel like I have no privacy or freedom from advertising. I would certainly not hand the device to a child. I recommend this if you want a cheap tablet but be aware of what else you're getting.",,
5,,"Good Product for Price..Larger Size May Be Better I think it's a good price and product.  For holding in your hand, I recommend a larger size, which might be more comfortable.",,,
6,,,,,"Honestly? For inside functions: Keep looking.... Edit: AND THE START UP SOUND IS LOUD AND NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF!!!Ok ok....I got this thing for Christmas and have been trying so hard to give it a chance and I gotta say....It is the most finicky device for the price I've ever had. So if you want a good reading Device you can actually read PDFs on without hassle? Keep looking.You want to use audiobooks at all as well? Keep looking.Discord for a bigger screen?: Keep looking...Genshin Impact? Yeah nope.Games?: Nope.And basically what I'm saying here is.....It's very limited. Plus? I can no longer Send To Kindle...I would definitely not recommend it. Look for a better and more affordable Tablet that can probably still double as a Reader/Kindle...I am a lover of clear big screens, not heavy gadgets, GOOD cases (found one that is awesome), and functionality in media....Not limits... So no, I wouldn't recommend or buy another. It's a lesson learned. Course, I wouldn't buy an ipad either."
7,,,Needs a volume boost big time for some movies depending on the site used Video volume won't turn up any higher,,
8,,"Does Everyting I Purchased It For Originally began my search with a laptop in mind.  Discovered a tablet could / would do everything that I wanted.  Next decision, what is the best size and at what price.  Decided on the Fire 8.  Grave discussion between the 10 vs. the 8.  The 8 won solely on price.  If it didn't do what I wanted, I would only be out $50.00 vs. double that.  Decided I could afford to lose $50 vs. $100.  It works extremely well for the exact reasons I purchased it for.  And, guess what???  I personally appreciate the smaller size.  Once again, I does everything I purchased it for.  By the way, had to purchase some noise cancelling ear phones to listen to music or watch movies on an airplane.  Hopefully, no big deal...",,,
9,,,,,"Not even two weeks and it’s bad Had since May 5th now it’s been working better than. The 7. But then started saying water detected near port unplug. Well first off it’s not even plugged up, nor been near water. SMH. What did you do send me a refurbished tablet for the price of a new one. Not in time I’ve had it has it been near water and how does it detect water while I’m sitting here watching a show and not even plugged up. Yea def. Done with tablets from Amazon. Going to iPads might be better luck there. The customer service said they could it replace it I could only send it back. Ridiculous"

8,,,,Good Alternative to IPad I like the larger screen size. I had the version that was made in 2017 or 2018. It served its useful purpose (it still works). I also like the expandable memory slot.,
9,,,,,It’s just ok It’s a older model. Maybe something good for kids.
0,,,,,"Slow, freezes, button placement sucks I don't think I've hated a tablet more. This thing is not even a year old and it constantly freezes and operates at the speed of someone who is riddled with malware. Additionally the thing that I hate the most is the button placement!! Whose brilliant idea was it to put the screen button right next to the volume buttons?? This is insanely annoying and I have accidentally shut my screen off more times than I care to admit. All in all this was one of the worst tablet purchases ever, good job amazon."
1,,,,,Disappointed Some of the games my family play did not download and the ones that did won't load. Unable to play any games. We have the 7 and love it but this 8 is a big disappointment. Hate to throw it in the trash but!
2,,it has a beautiful picture and the sound is awesome ,,,
3,,Ideal para niños La compré para mi hija de 9 años y le ha servido muy bien. Ya tenía una Amazon Tablet previa que también es muy buena.,,,
4,,,Very slow It’s a great price and you get what you pay for but the screen and tablet itself isn’t very reactive and lags a lot even upon first time turning it on. It will do but wish I had spent the extra money and gotten an iPad.,,
5,,Muy buena Excelente producto a un muy buen precio,,,
6,very small its way small then I thought it would be. too small and it dose not even seem like its brand new!! it kept getting hot and turning off and on . NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID.,,,,

9,Screen is noticeably below every phone made in the last 5 years or so Maybe mine is defective I'm not sure. But the screen definition or resolution is really bad. The colors have no pop to them and it's all very flat. I had a 4 year old fire 10 I was replacing and this is a significant downgrade. Even on sale I am disappointed.,,,,

1,,The only thing I don't like The only thing I don't like is their charging port because it  is for my kid so I went and got the magnet adapter for it. No more issues,,,
2,don't buy it glitches to much its slow it glitches I can't play my favorite game on it very disappointing and they won't give me my money back cause it's been more then 30 days but I expect a tablet to last me years and it messed up after 2 months don't by horrible,,,,
3,,what I wanted what I wanted,,,
4,,,Great when they work The Fire tablets are great when they work. They are a beginners/kids. The reason for my low star count is because I am on my third of these tablets that just don't work well. My 5 year old has the worst luck. The screens on her tablets don't always stay bright. They randomly become so dim you can't see what should be displayed on the screen. Though the brightness setting is at maximum it is very very dim,,
5,,,,,Returned It. Inadequate Syncing Would not sync with my old Fire. Would have lost quite a few of my free games.
6,,"Great for renewed device. Aside from a few tiny nicks and scrapes o the back of my tablet, if I had not looked closely, I would say this was brand new! I am very happy with my device!",,,
7,"🤬Device is fully controlled by Amazon! Amazon has way too much control over the device making a completely useless piece of trash. Constantly downloading apps I don’t want and updates in the background. No you can’t turn this off.  Also, downloaded media constantly disappears and have to download again. Not even worth the $45 I paid! 🤬",,,,

0,,"Fabulous for reading, music, purchasing what I need w/o leaving my house.. My biggest complaint is I can not deal with my MEDICAL ISSUES using this  HD 8 Tablet...Besides that I use this tablet for everything else..... Shopping, music, and most of all my reading.  My only complaint would be with the battery life... It seems to me that listening to music seems to use up the battery rather quickly.  BUT that could be my fault!!!  I am a ""TECHNO IDIOT"" and there probably is a way to minimize battery life during different types of tablet usage.  Just to let anyone who should read this I have bought 5 of these HD8 10th gen. Tablets and 1 was a refurbished one and all the people I gave them to absolutely love them.  My only advise is get one with 64gb instead of the 32gb version.  Especially if you love music and books....Thank you and be HAPPY..... EASYE",,,
1,,,,"Just one complaint First off I love the size, and the quality of the screen is great. I use it to read mostly but I do watch streaming media like Netflix a good bit. No issues there.The one thing that I absolutely can’t stand and which drives me crazy is the keyboard! I love being able to slide a finger over the keyboard to type instead of typing out each letter. While that is something that can be done, the accuracy is horrendous! I’ve had a number of Kindles over the years and never had the kind of problems like what I have with this Kindle’s keyboard. That aspect seriously needs improvements made.Overall I’m happy with it!",

The storage space is a good amount too.",,,
6,,,,Good for the price. This one s my 3rd tablet.  One and two lasted 4 years each. The complaint I have about this one is it just goes dark. The battery is charged and the only way I can figure how to fix it is to plug it in and unplug when screen starts over. Very perplexing.,

It had not been around any moisture at all. It would not connect to my TV via a USB-C to HDMI cable - moisture error again. Called customer service and was guided to do a factory reset. He said he would call me back on 1 hr to check status. 2 hrs later no call. I called back. Someone else did updates for the tablet and said he would call back in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later no call. I called back and got yet a different person. She said I could do an exchange and I said I was done and just wanted to return.

0,,,This will be my last one I have been buying the Kindle Fire tablet for several year now. This time around it took about 5 hours for me to get it started. Why I dont really have the answer. I was about to start a return on it. And finally it kicked in. There was battery so it was not that. The only conclusion was that its an older model. Maybe sitting on the shelf too long. Time to upgrade Amazon your stock. Next time it will be a better brand. Cost was the only factor why I continued to buy their brand. But not again.,,

I was so disappointed when I opened the box that I didn’t even turn the device on. It was large, so wide so I could barely put my hand around it, heavier and thicker. I don’t understand why a new design was worse than the older model. I returned it and replaced it with an Android device. I do a lot of reading and need something that is comfortable in my hand."

This 8"" Fire however is another story. I end up with a display much more like my desktop in usability. It responds well. It was incredibly easy to set up since we already had Amazon Echoes in the house, Alexa on the phone, this Fire immediately synched to the existing Amazon account and our Wi-Fi, no typing in passwords and codes. The Silk browser seems much better than it did years back and very quickly I was setting up my favorite sites and so on.I does have ads on the lock screen but once I type in my passcode there isn't much Amazon sales intrusion in my opinion.

4,,Fantastic! Very good screen but best of all great DOLBY SPEAKERS I am so glad I bought the Fire 8. The latest 2020 release has in my opinion even better Dolby speakers (2) than my Fire 10 latest model. All those negative reviews I read must have been referring to earlier models.Still this model won't support JBL speakers but my Tribit and Monster speaker work well. Another minor problem remains I haven't had success pairing two speakers but the volume of the single speaker is as loud or louder than a pair of speakers on my Fire 10.The bezel is 58ths of an inch perfect for my thumb to grip this light weight tablet.I like this so much that I think I will gift friends with one. One correction. After awhile my speaker pairing waz accepted by the tablet.,,,
5,,,App not available I wish that I had not ordered an advertisement enable device.  If I had known I couldn't add Nook app to this device I wouldn't have ordered it at all.

9,,,,Money well spent I like using this for reading and video conferencing family.,
0,,Fire is right! I’ve found the series 8 Fire tablet to be everything it said in the description and more. I absolutely love my tablet especially since I read a lot and to be able to carry my “books” without the added weight of physical books. I recommend this tablet highly and have to other people about it. They will likely be  getting one of them as well.,,,
1,,,"Batteries die in about 2 years It's a high quality tablet, they do everything a tablet is supposed to do and they do it well.

I have 5 of these...3 HD 8's a 10 and a 7 ....my 7 still works great, slow, but decent for what I paid for it, but it's screen resolution and sound are of mediocre quality. The 8's and the 10 are great, and every one I've had dies in about 2 years. Planned obsolescence at it's highest form. Buy a better one or be prepared to pay $35 a year for the privilege of paying $130 more for Prime. I'm rethinking my online entertainment provider and I'm not buying any more Fire tablets...

Called customer service, assumed they would just swap it out, but no.

For less than $100 it is a phenomenal buy.  Speedy, responsive, and has a pretty good screen.  It's not an iPad Air, but it's cheaper than a set of air pods!The speakers are great compared to any tablet I've ever had.  They can actually be used for music.The OS seems a little 'clunky' at first but once you get used to it it's fine.  When I first got it I tried to turn it into a real Android tablet.  Turns out I didn't need to.  I was able to get everything I needed to run on it without rooting or any other trickery.The only (small) problem is that the plastic case is quite slippery.

1,,,"Wall-mounted pad for Alexa smart home control? Sorta.. I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home.  For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.Smart Home Dashboard:The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality.  You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality.  The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version.  It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI — it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.User ExperienceShovelware!  The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter.  Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication.  The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop.  This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.Media PlaybackThe speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver.  This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or—I'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids—little for the grown-ups—and none for my purpose.I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.Bottom LinePros:—Price—3rd party mounting optionsCons:—Shovelware!!—Lack of full device support in ""show mode""—Ugly native Alexa app—Sub-par media connectivity—Limited to Amazon-sanctioned music services—App store lacking apps for grown-ups—Limited config/UI optionsSomeday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment.  They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services—only Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.Good luck!",,

7,"Almost total garbage I bought this for $35 and whether it was worth it or not is questionable. This is 100% due to the MediaTek precessor. I knew going in that MediaTek itIs terrible but this is a new level of bad. Websites simply will not load or take forever to load. Pages jump around and struggle to load. YouTube videos stutter. A simple site like Autotrader is impossible to use. CNN and Fox news overwhelm it as well. Before somebody cries about internet connection, this is 500Mb.TLDR: the only thing this is good for is maybe being a cheaper Kindle. Never ever buy anything with a MediaTek chipset.",,,,
8,,"Great product, but why couldn't I buy it directly from Amazon? Great product. This is my 5th or 6th Kindle Fire & was a gift for my 93 yo mother-in-law who has vision problems. We both love our Kindles.Amazon didn't like my 1st review because they think it contained feedback it doesn't allow. It doesn't. Actually, if a person saw my review they'd see it asks a question, one that I haven't been able to get an answer to.My question is - but why couldn't I buy it directly from Amazon Australia? And why won't Amazon US ship a Kindle Fire to me in Australia? I had to buy it from a 3rd party. Frustrating. Almost as frustrating as trying to get an answer out of Amazon.com about why this is the case. I don't care if you don't post this, but I would like someone in Amazon to get back to me with an answer.",,,

5,,"versatile tablet with extreme value I needed an android tablet for a cloud based tablet app and media streaming.  After searching high and low, there was only one choice based on my limited budget.  It is not fast, but certainly usable for my app.The only thing is that this tablet is a heavily modified android (or Fire OS) tablet and I couldn't use it as is.Rather than trading up to a more expensive tablet, I've used Fire Toolbox V27.0 to install Google Play and then installed my app through the play store. I've installed VNC server to remotely administer.The android app works fine with the new setup.  I ""pin"" the app so that the tablet is dedicated to the app.I wanted to be able to track down the tablet but Google's Phone locator does not work because there is no GPS.  When I kicked off sound the device, nothing.  After about 30 minutes, the tablet starts beeping.  Maybe that is better than not being able to find it at all.The battery lasts much longer than any phones I've used.With some issues identified, I'm quite happy with Fire HD 8 and would recommend to anyone who needs android tablets.",,,

8,,Kindle Fires are the best I had a 1st generation fire- was still doing great 10 years later but finally decided to upgrade.  The turnover was seemless - only had to tell Amazon to use my prime account and it easily loaded all my info when I turned it on.  I mostly use to read but am happy I upgraded.  Battery REALLY lasts.  Some set up on this is better. Some I don't like as well but still good.  Does take a little longer to load and get to a book but not annoyingly so - just good to be prepared.  Definitely worth the price!  So much better than other pads I have seen.,,,

0,,,,,"If this is an improvement, I’d hate to see what it replaced So, I bought this to replace my poor aging iPad Mini, which I use to shop for groceries, pay bills, and shop from other sites than Amazon… shocking news. So I charged the battery and tried to download my bank, power company, cable app etc, and I couldn’t. Which rendered it pretty much useless for anything other than Facebook, Twitter, and the like. Anything other than that, this thing is woefully underpowered.  Any games that require graphics like Call of Duty, or even Snoopy’s Town Tale lag so bad I’m still waiting for the game to load. I never tried anything like Netflix or Hulu. However the volume on this is so low, I can barely hear it… and I have excellent hearing..so I’m told. I guess I got what I paid for, so don’t expect much. The battery is fine, but considering how underpowered it is, it’s way too heavy. Also it turns itself off from time to time. I should have sent it back but honestly I gave the box to my cat, I figured one of us should get some enjoyment from this endeavor."

HOWEVER, when you turn the new one on or up push the power button to take it out of sleep mode, there is a static noise that it makes, like the speakers are going out of it.  Once it is up and running, it works fine, but i wonder every time is this will be the last time.  Picture and touch is great.",

2,,,,,"no user guide included Overall this is a pretty good tablet. It's main drawback is that it does not have a user's guide supplied with it. The set up is given in a small 2-page booklet but after that you're left alone with no idea of how to do anything. This gets pretty frustrating having to do things by trial-and-error. There is a Help function but this is only helpful if you have a specific problem, it doesn't explain how to use the tablet. There are tons of guides for sale in the store, but you shouldn't have to purchase more after buying the tablet just to learn how to use it. If a guide was supplied, then this would be rated a 4 or 5."

The others have, stopped working for things like: froze and quit working after 5 months of use, no apparent reason. Amazon offerd 15% off a new one.

Had a 7 and it was unbearably slow...thought it was time to upgrade to 8.  I bought this tablet specifically to play Amazon Music at my work.  You'd think that with their OWN app it would be speedy but not at all.  Not to mention that even though the songs are downloaded to the tablet, they STILL do not always play without a skip.  And of course filled with tons of Amazon bloatware that cannot be deleted.At this point, I'm going to give it another day, see if I can mess with some settings that will improve speed but most likely return it since it's so damn slow.  If I do find a fix then I will update this review.  I am guessing I can find an old refurbished tablet from Samsung that will still be faster.  So disappointing.  Sorry Amazon...tried to support you but you guys failed big time.",,,,

I love my kindle paper white and was surprised how inferior kindle fire (or at least the one they sent me) was). I downloaded 4 apps, and 4 kindle books within that app, and explored the basic workings for about 15 minutes and used up over 20% battery power in that short time. I plugged the device into my charger and checked back an hour later and discovered I only gained 2% !?!?!?  There is a slow hesitancy that occurred when using it and Images were grainy. I sent it back the next morning. Still no tablet but I cannot even settle for the poor quality of the device i ordered.  As stated, perhaps I was spoiled by the way more expensive mini “i “ tablet I owned or the kindle fire I received was a lemon. Regardless, I’ll go without until I can afford a superior product.

So if you're into most things Amazon: Alexa, Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Prime Video, Amazon Games, Amazon Photo, & Kindle on a Tablet, then I Highly Recommend This Budget-Friendly Tablet For You!But I was looking for a Tablet to 📖 my Kindle 📚 on instead. I was hoping it had a similar Battery Life as my Kindle Paperwhite; I doesn't 😒. I appreciate being able to surf the Internet, & Access my Amazon Account thru it's App. But I'm not interested most of Apps that came Installed on the Tablet. Most Can't Be Uninstalled; & they eat up the Battery Charge Quickly! ☹️So if you're looking for a Tablet to 📖 your Kindle 📚 on, That Isn't the Kindle App, but more like a Kindle Paperwhite, This Isn't What You Want! ⭐⭐⭐",,

Thus one had many more features, including camera, internet compatibility with a functioning Silk browser. 1st Generation is NOT compatible with internet, only able to download new books. I must turn off internet connection with the 1st  except when downloading from Amazon. The new one has trouble with one finger (thumb) page changing and it will easily flip many pages not intentionally chosen. One can spend quite some time finding where in the book one wants to return .The charger is not usable, but with the USB-C cord and with one of  the many chargers we all accumulate, it does well charging, signals with a chime when it begins.  Battery life is less compared with 1st generation and kindle white.",

I already have three of these, one in my bedroom for watching movies (Blacky) another at my desk (Blu), and a general purpose one (Slate) and now yes...(Whitey) just because!The HD is the best overall value giving Excellent online performance, excellent video, Superb Sourround Sound, easy to put Google Play on so you get tons more Apps, it just does Everything Well!Hot Tip, grab a Capacitve discharge stylus pen for $5.99 (no more ucky screen from your fingers) and a lot more precise and effortless navigating an already great touch screen.I know, I might give the impression I really like the Fire 8 HD.....naah, just your imagination!P.S.  A good alternative to Google Play without the hassle is go to APKPURE.com or UPTODOWN.com where you can get many of the same Apps and games as GP, grab a good ad blocking browser like the VIA browser or Opera and turn on their ad blockers and things will quickly speed up because the main reason this tablet can be super slow is the Amazon browser just has very poor Ad Blocking.",,,

I recently decided to read a few of the real books that I had and left the Fire unplugged for a few weeks. I knew the battery was drained so I charged it for a full day before starting it up.  Well, now it won't turn on, just a black screen. After several calls to customer service I found out that you can't let the battery stay drained for that long or it won't turn back on....At all.  Since the new battery is the same as the new fire, I opted to purchase a new one.  Amazon offers a trade in program if you purchase a new Fire except mine isn't on the list BECAUSE IT'S TOO NEW!!  There are lists of previous versions but because mine is the latest version, there is no trade in value.  And customer service is perplexed when asked to escalate or ask a manager.",,,,

Amazon's Silk Browser is good but if you prefer Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome you are out of luck. The Amazon email app is pretty cool and you CAN get Microsoft Outlook. Actual Google things are basically unavailable so be aware of that. Maybe you already know this stuff... I didn't. For me, that frustration is outweighed by the value to price ratio.

We're both readers; she loves large type; I prefer paper, (except for the heavy, thick books). Fine so far, anxious to put the Tablet part to the test. BUT there's very little type-size variation, not at all like the five-year-old Kindle I've been using. The new Fire goes from small type to eye chart! Not good. The only workaround I've found is changing the typeface; some are larger as a matter of their composition. The limited ability to change type size is the only reason for 4 stars, at least at this point. Thank you.",

Honestly, I would still be using my old 2016 8"" HD Fire if I hadn't damaged the screen attempting to replace the battery.  Anyhow, I have a desk top computer and an iPhone 6S Plus and until both of those as dead as my old Fire tablet I have no need to replace them.My new tablet?  I use for reading and playing a few word games.  So I don't need anything super fancy although, my new Fire is so pretty.  I opted for the white version and I have a minimal case on it.  I love the sleep/wake function - some of the newer tables have stopped making them with that function.  I returned a more expensive tablet because it did not have that.The weight of this gen 10/2020 unit is so nice for reading - has the same footprint as an average size novel.My greatest complaint is Amazon's App Store is rather pathetic though it is easy to side load 3rd party apps.  My favorite reading app is Moon Reader Plus and my favorite book organization app is Calibre.  Have used both those apps through several different tablets and they make reading any format a joy.So far I love my new fire.  If you are not a heavy gamer requiring a super fast processor this tablet is very nice for the price.  I did pay extra to get rid of the ads.  They are so annoying.  Even though it isn't lightening fast, videos play beautifully on it.  Good Job Amazon.",,,

 This is the third fire hd8 tablet I bought. The first two tablets were given to my two daughters as gifts. This one is for myself. I bought it to watch videos, check information, and play small games. I'm not a heavy gamer, so it's enough for me, I have an ipad at home, and a laptop. I use them for complex stuff. I have downloaded the google store and the Chinese app store. For those who say that they are restricted by the Amazon program, I don't think it affects me, because I can download all the apps I need. And for those who say it's underpowered, I think it's true for some games, but I'm not affected because I don't play much. Also for children's apps, it basically works perfectly. It is suitable for children. I still feel very comfortable watching the video {I have put on the tempered film, my eyes will feel a lot more comfortable, I am a myopic patient, I will be more sensitive to the screen light} I suggest that everyone must buy a protective screen tempered film, and an anti-screen Dropped protective case. It's really important, because it's not very drop-resistant, and for those who want to use it for a long time, good protection measures are still necessary.

2,"What so great about having a Kindel? Having this device is a captive experience and not always useful. I purchased all e-textbooks from another vendor (at the time the Kindel was not available at any store), and I am not able to download them to this device from my computer, unless I purchase another set of e-textbooks from Amazon, as told by the Amazon technicians. That will never happen. I was also informed to purchase additional equipment to make the Kindel adaptable for downloading from my computer. That'll never happen. This extended delay in purchasing the device, caused me to drop a class because I was so behind not having this device. I spent three days on telephone calls with technicians from Dell Computer and Amazon. So, what is so great about having this device, I have yet to learn, someone please let me know?",,,,

That’s an easy decision anyday!Yes, Amazon jams the tablet with bloat ware and advertising. However, I just put all the bloat ware apps into one folder (since you literally cannot delete those apps). The opening screen advertising is easy to ignore as well.",,,

0,,"Nice upgrade from the earlier 7th gen. But watch out for covers! Having owned a 7th gen Fire8 since they were first discounted (4 years+?), I wondered when would be a good time to upgrade and if the upgrade would actually be worth the money; would I get better performance? And what does ""better performance"" mean?I'm happy to report that this 10th gen model is faster - enough so that web browsing and doing eMail isn't a PITA. There are a few other apps I use that ""feel"" faster (I have no benchmarks to report), as well.This 10th gen model may be hacked to run Google's PlayStore and, therefore, PlayBooks (which I prefer to Amazon's Kindle-walled-garden). I do love the backlit screen as it lets me read in much lower light levels than the e-ink Kindle models. Yeah; I know about the ring of lights around the e-ink Kindle's screen but I get a cleaner image with true backlighting.One thing I found very quickly as I was searching for a good, protective case/cover: The new locations of the front camera -and- the speakers means that virtually all the third-party case/covers either open left-to-right (instead of the traditional right-to-left) and/or position the speakers at the bottom rather than at the top when propped up in landscape mode. Those that do manage to keep the speakers at the top tend to have holes punched into what would be described as a ""living hinge""; I've seen a number of reports that these covers tear off![Edit: Third-party covers also seem to have ""too-powerful"" magnets so that when the cover is flipped around to the rear (which is the usual method when reading), the magnets activate the sleep function (which should only be activated when the cover is on the front side).So my solution was to simply buy the genuine Kindle case/cover sold by Amazon as it resolves all of these issues (as in ""doesn't have them""). It was about $10 more than the ""cheap"" third-party units but I don't see this unit needing to be replaced. I can't vouch for the amount of protection offered by this case (as I have never dropped my Kindles) but it does protect it well when I pack it into my ""technology bag"" for travel or in a coat pocket. You may find that case/cover here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y8YNDM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (Note I bought the charcoal unit but there are other colors.)",,,

I expect this new one is made pretty much the same way.Still, it's likely the best product for reading e-books, so I bought a replacement.  l like the new features, and the screen is slightly bigger than the old Fire 8, which is a definite plus. Amazon Alexa is also a nice feature, and almost always understands what I'm saying.Though I don't look forward to purchasing another one any time soon, if I do need a replacement, I'll get another Fire 8 HD.",

6,"Would be great if it didn't have to live next to a wall plug The screen on this is decent, more than usable so no complaints there. The touch sensor is off so it will often go to a link next to the one I touched and of course there's no way to recalibrate it because that just wouldn't make ANY sense for . . . reasons I guess. The battery life is paradoxically great, it will last for a long LONG time. Unfortunately however the Kindle inexplicably shuts off at random and will not power back on without being plugged in no matter what the charge level is, 40% - 90+% makes no difference. I've been reading a book on it, put it in my pocket to walk upstairs and when I take it out of my pocket it's turned itself off and won't turn back on until I plug it in and that's what 110% earns it a one star review. Absolutely insane, I finally just turned it off and tossed it under my bed.",,,,

3,,"Easy set up and use I got this to replace an older 10"" fire tablet that I used mostly to read on.  I am able to surf the web and access my online accounts (not just Amazon) I had a 7"" android tablet that when it died was replaced with the 10"". I found the 7"" to be a little too small for what I wanted and the 10"" too big. I got this 8"" mostly because it was on sale for about 50% off, making it around $45. It is a nice size to read on, a bigger screen than the 7"" and not as bulky as the 10"". I like that I can change the screen color it helps with the reading.  The touch screen works well, and the battery life is great. I received this Monday and charged it (it came partially charged) and I have used it all week, 3-4hrs at a time without having to recharge (it is now at 57%) The setup is nothing, I think it took 5 minutes or so, the settings are easy to find and easy to use. As I mostly use it to read, I am not sure about the sound quality, but the sound for notifications and the alarm is louder than my phone when both are turned up on high.  At $45 I would buy again, but I don't know if I would at $90. Probably not.",,,

As far as I can tell, the only security cam app available in the Amazon App Store is for Blink which happens to be owned by Amazon.  I can run Google Chrome on my iPhone, but Jeff Bezos brooks no competition.Every time I pick up the thing it tries to sell me Amazon products and services."
0,,,,"No official YouTube app in Amazon app store, but there are work around a. Got a tablet for $45, pretty amazing deal. I asked a question on this page if the official YouTube app could be installed and was told yes, just go to the Amazon app store and download. This is false information, all the YouTube apps on the Amazon store are knock offs. However, there is a workaround. You have to download several .APK files, including Google play, Google services, Google framework, etc. But when you're done, you have access to the Google play store on your kindle fire. You can download basically any android app after that. I downloaded every app I wanted, there was nothing I wasnt able to download. Got Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, YouTube kids, Roku remote, Facebook, Facebook messeneger, Google assistant, HBO Max, all the official android versions. This is my one problem with the Kindle fire, the lack of apps on the native app store. There's no YouTube, no YouTube kids, no Google maps, no Gmail, no Chrome. These are all essential apps. But, with a little bit of knowledge, and effort, it's all possible. I'm very happy with this tablet, for $45 it's a complete steal. It can be pretty laggy at times, but it was freaking $45, I'm not expecting a flagship workhorse. The ad lockscreen is not annoying to me, it always unlocks instantly, think of it as a random changing lockscreen. I can't tell you one ad I've seen on the lockscreen, I just dont pay attention. This can also be changed with a little knowledge and know-how. Google is your friend, ask it a question, and it will answer.",
1,"Won't turn on unless attached to power source. This has been a fine kindle. But in the last two days, right at the one year owned mark, it won't start up. I just get a completely blank screen as if it is completely dead. Even though it is fully charged. But if I attach it to a power source, it will immediately start up. The screen also has lost its sensitivity. I have other kindles that have lasted years.

Games are hit or miss if they will play smoothly or not. If you are just using it to watch the occasional movie or as an e reader it's probably fine.,
7,"Silk Browser is Awful Thank you, Amazon, for selfishly not allowing for parental controls of porn and other explicit websites on your crappy browser. Despite trying to restrict the Silk browser from allowing a search on websites like these, it seems impossible. My young was able to find porn websites. Thanks again. We will not be purchasing any further Fire Tablets.",,,,
8,,,Almost love it. Works great for what I intended it for. Only problem is it will randomly shut off. You can not turn it back on unless you plug it in. And when you plug it in comes right on and shows battery life not even close to being dead. Usually high 70-80. If it wasn't for that I'd love it.,,

You need four other apps first that must be sideloaded (not available for download in Amazon App Store) But....you must make sure you download the correct version for whichever fire tablet you have.I remember why I threw out my parents firestick and got them a Chromecast with Google TV.

The Fire 8 tablet can be set to work with your Amazon ALEXIS for added home security services, which I love having!!I keep discovering how much more that my Fire 8 tablet is capable of doing in comparison to the Fire 7 tablet!! I'm really thrilled that things actually worked in my favor with my return and my newer tablet purchased!!THANK YOU, Amazon for all of the help you gave me in these Amazon transactions!!Jan",,,
3,,"Everything great! I waited several weeks to make this purchase because I already had an ipad touch. Then I got this and was glad I made the purchase. The size, the ease of using and the features. Bought the faster charging plug for it. I could not be more pleased with purchases. Great battery life and no problems with video. Only seems a bit slow powering up and loading sites. I am basically thrilled with fire tablet 8 (10th generation) and it was an incredible bargain!!! Try it! Oh and it synchronized easily.",,,

Downloaded the Children's app in China, and the children's APP in the United States! Will receive its protective case at night! I'm so glad I bought this! It's very cost-effective! I'm waiting for my third HD8 package! I bought that for myself! No need to compete with kids to use it! They like to watch videos on HD8, and play alphabet games app. If you have children at home, you can buy it, stick toughened film with a protective cover! It's perfect!",,,

It took an hour to move and everything either disappeared completely or was even slower (if possible) than when it was installed onboard. However, even those apps weren’t “there” just the icon. I hate these products. And I’m souring on the parent company as well. AVOID",,,,

Sometimes it's slow  compared to my 400 dollar phone but I paid 45 bucks for this and it does the few things I wanted it for pretty awesomely. If it goes on sale again I might just buy a spare,
4,"Advertising for free! The biggest thing to know about this tablet is it has built in advertising.  If you buy it from a third party, you're in that advertising mode, and there's no way to reverse it without spending a premium fee to amazon.  I don't support any hardware that comes prepacked with an ad everytime you unlock it.  That said, if you buy this tablet, you need to combat anti consumer ownership practices.",,,,

3,"Dangerous—melted charger & charging port This kindle always got hot while charging. Earlier this week, the kindle got so hot it melted both the charging port and the charger. I’ve had this for less than a year, and have always used the provided charger. There’s no reason a basically new device should melt, let alone make me worried it could get so hot it melt more than the plug and spark a fire.Since this happened I’ve seen the same thing has happened with this and older versions of Kindle Fire tablets, so this is not a one-off issue.Amazon was also not helpful in addressing the issue, and seemed unconcerned that the product was potentially dangerous. I was offered a 15% discount on buying a new one, but since I don’t want my house to catch fire, I think I’ll pass.",,,,

8,,"It's really great! This activity price bought! Enough for the kids! Children's education app! The media could not be loaded.
                



 Rarely, but I just want to say. Whether it's watching videos or children's apps running perfectly, some light game Chinese apps can also be downloaded and run! It's really enough for kids! I love it! I think I will keep buying after the new version comes out! The kids love it too! The iPad at home became a throwaway object, rushing to play with the Amazon tablet! You may think it's exaggerated but it's true! Don't be limited by the Amazon app, which is essentially an Android tablet! Hey hey 😁",,,
9,,"I upgraded from the 7 to the 8 and I love it. I got the 7in and about a month later I upgraded to the 8in HD. I'm so glad I did. The battery life is way better, the size and weight are great. With the 7, I had to charge it once a day. If I wasn't using it, it would just die. Not the 8. I can use it for a couple of days and be fine.This charges with a USB-C, which all my devices charge with, so it's easy to find a charger. It acts as an Alexa, so if you don't want to get the Alexa device and just prop the Fire 8 on a stand, it's perfect for that as well. The processor on this is not much faster, but fast enough that I feel a lot better using it.My only con is the speakers. I didn't expect them to be great, but the volume is so low even when at its highest setting. I don't mind using headphones, but I like to fall asleep to a good book, but I can't hear as well.Totally worth the upgrade though.",,,

I use them for all sorts of applications, reading, gaming, or finding the newest thing I need.  Love these each and every one.

8,Maybe for Adults Went from using Lenovo tablet to using this one and it's much worse. Apps are only available for download from them and can't even load YouTube.

Tablet is cheap, most apps crash on it or work very slowly.

I can’t even repair it. Guy at shop said that since there cheap it’s cheaper to buy a new one…Battery works fine and I can still use it with the cracks but I honestly don’t know what to do with it."

8,,,,,NOT for AMAZON MUSIC! NOT a good streamer. I bought this just to use with my stereo through blue-tooth streaming.  The Amazon Music interface barely works on this thing.  Most of the software on the tablet is slow.  The only thing that seems to work is the settings menu.  I even used an SD card to store the music on but it was bogged down either way.  Pretty sad given that this is an Amazon product.

It’s a great tablet and I’d definitely recommend it to parents looking for an affordable option for their kiddos, but as far as using it for myself, it’s nothing remarkable. I purchased it for the sole purpose of reading ebooks, and unless you want to purchase a Kindle subscription there aren’t too many options available in the App Store. If it’s not either owned by or in partnership with Amazon, you’re not going to have a easy time accessing it. The best way I enjoy it without all the distracting ads is when I disconnect it from the internet. Overall I’m not saying it’s a bad tablet, it’s great! But it does seem to beat you over the head with Amazon “imagery.”",,

At first it was pretty good, but the standard computer industry regimen of endless updates slowed it to a crawl by 3/22. Or at least I assume that's what happened; it seems to happen to everything else, windows 10 for instance, but I guess the Fire HD8 didn't start fast-enough or who knows. ... I didn't find the other built-in annoyances -- the advertising and various other limitations -- to be that annoying, but finally it got so I couldn't get a web page in less than a minute or two.Thu 8/18/2022 1:01 pm.

The battery life of my old Fire was excellent and long lasting. This one not so much!!! I think the difference is due to the MANY ads that I have to endure before actually being able to play Solataire (which is what I do most). I also use it for reading and I find it awkward to hold, probably because my other Fire was only 6 inches and therefore much easier to hold. I am also unhappy with the cover I purchased for it. From the picture, I thought I was getting a leather cover like the one I had, but it is plastic and adds to the difficulty in holding it. I am a very positive person so I don’t like giving a review this bad, but truthfully, I am very unhappy with my purchase. Unfortunately, I chose to keep it so I am bearing with it!"

1,,Software for the Kindle Fire  8 The software for this unit is very poorly developed.  It is NOT easy for the average user to comprehend….  The initial Kindle developed was done well and was easy to learn.This Fire 8 lacks basic logic……. It more like a “scatter brain” approach for the average user to operate...  There are so many errors of judgement in the software development.. There isn’t a tutorial that allows the User to understand the nuances of the software of the Unit to suit themselves…..  There are useless symbols such a circles or * shape that mean nothing and lacks definition and one would have to be a magician with a crystal ball to figure out how to basically use the device and alter it for independent use.  The developer who created this software needs to go back to school and learn what the term “intuitive” means….  And then learn how to put it to use for everyone to use the device…..  Its what I call the “scatter brain” approach to software development…..  It’s a failed model…Jim,,,

Given it's age  I decided to upgrade to a newer version (8, 2020 release) to get: a slightly larger screen, longer battery life, more RAM, and dual speakers.  I use my kindle 90% for reading--usually  e-books borrowed from the library-- and about 10%, esp. when I'm traveling, for email and  to read e-newspapers .For the most part, I'm quite happy with the new replacement--Particularly  the larger screen keyboard. Transitioning from an older version to the new one was seamless. For those that fret over the ads,  my response is ""What ads?"" as I'm fortunate enough to be able to mentally  block them.  I have only one negative comment of major note:  On my old Kindle, the power and volume buttons  <on the side>  were  recessed;  on the newer one, both buttons are raised.  This means when one is holding the unit, it's too easy to accidently lightly touch them and power off or change the volume.  Now that's annoying!  This never happened on the older one with recessed buttons.",

There's to many commercials. Every time you open it. It's to be expected if you've gone on Amazon website, otherwise its just annoying... 2nd, I have No interest in Alexa and I don't like the fact it's always running in the background using up battery power.. It's impossible to get into the cloud easily and lastly and most irritating is the layout of the Library to many hoops to jump through just to look at the titles and the inability to change your preferences... The product is fine the app design is crap....",
4,,,,Overall it works pretty well This is my 5th Fire tablet. The 4th one was returned because it kept diaconneting from internet. I was sent s replacement and seems to be working ok. One complaint ids the on/off was moved from the top right corner to the middle which is awkward to use. The screen seems a little to sensitive.,

When I am reading at my preferred screen brightness, it will go dim. I mostly use the Fired for reading e-books, so this is annoying. It also does it on news articles. The prompt to go back or forward a page does not work right either. Very slow and sometimes take 3-4 taps to make it work. I won't buy this brand again."

Nice specs are sufficient to use for schooling, or normal everyday use like email, internet browsing, YouTube, NetFlix, Games. I have purchased 5 of these tablets. Three (3) were good.But two (2) were faulty with manufacturing issues... bought tablet for son, after 4 months the (micro usb) charging port failed and tablet would not accept charging no matter how many cable I connected and tried.  I took it to the repair shop, they asked USD$55 to fix the charging port. Another tablet failed as the screen just went black. It worked and it could charge but you cannot see anything on the screen. I think I will exchange this bad screen on the tablet with the good screen on the tablet having the bad charging port.  Will visit the repair shop to get advice on that.The other three (3) good tablets I purchased before the Covid-19 crisis are fully functional and perform well without any issues. Its over 3 years now.",

Second thing was that for some reason it got slow after one app and pop up ads come out on the Lock Screen every time. The ads came included I wonder if there’s a way to turn them off.

There is NO home button and it's extremely difficult/impossible to swipe up for the virtual buttons while an app is loaded. Only way to exit is to RESTART. The touch screen is among the worst I've ever experienced. You're better off with a android or apple device. This also doesn't have all apps. NO YOUTUBE KIDS! You have to hack the thing to get the play store. I wish I could return it but I purchased early as Xmas gift and now been too long. I'll never buy these again. Absolutely horrible.",,,,

Once an app loads it works pretty well but simply tasks like navigating to, opening and closing an app take an extremely long time.We purchased this tablet to work with the Osmo system and don't use it otherwise which means it's not overweight with data and it's still just terribly slow. I guess if you have no other option than you can make it work but honestly I would look elsewhere.",,,,

I read almost all books on my Kindle and my wife enjoys the audio. We also subscribed to several magazines from Kindle Newstand. Access to Amazon's store is simple and the recommendations are always helpful. These are handy and versatile. It's great to get an immediate delivery of books and nice not to have books and magazines piling up.  Oh, I'll watch Prime Video sometime as well. I like it better on a wide screen of course but when I want to watch something while in bed then the Kindle fits the bill. There are other functions available which make the Kindle more useful but I haven't explored them. Highly recommended.",,,

5,,,,,"S L O W  and a poor browser. I bought this to use while reading / studying away from either my laptop or desktop, such as on couch or patio.  I use it primarily to access reference material.  I had been using an iPad that was old enough there were no longer updates for it.  I gave that to my grandkids to use to play games when in the car with no internet access.  I figured since all I needed to do was browse, surely this would work.  It is very slow to respond to commands and renders some very simple screens I use so differently than anything else I have used as to make it nearly unusable.  The speed is not my connection as I can use either my personal or work phones side by side and the difference is unbelievable.  5 seconds to load on the phone, 20-30 seconds on the Fire tablet.  I have a couple of apps on it and they seem to function much better (the only reason for the second star).  I have been through the settings a few times to insure something is not set up correctly or on/off in error.  No difference no matter what I do.  For me this has been a total waste of money."

9,,,,"Very goood but not 5 stars If you're buying primarily as a Kindle reader then get a regular Kindle reader.  As a Kindle it works just fine. No problems so far (I've only had it about a month). The built in browser is slow compared to using a tablet or phone. I was surprised when I was using the Amazon shopping site that the ""favorite heart"" seems to be missing, and again it's a little slow. The only other app I use often is the Ring app which has about the same speed as other devices. I ended up shutting off most notifications so I didn't get interrupted when reading.I cannot comment on other apps since I don't really use them on this device.I still would rather use Kindle on a small device  like this - bigger than a phone but smaller than my 10"" tablet.The battery life is not 12 hours if you read all day like I sometimes do. I get more like 8 hours - another reason to get a Kindle reader instead since they are advertised as having a much longer battery life.The screen is good and responsive.Price-wise, considering memory, this just seemed a better deal for me than a simple Kindle reader. I'm happy with it.",

After several years of using my phone (on the go, or at least away from my TV), I decided it was time to get another tablet. This happened to be on sale for about $45, and the fact that it has advertisements on the lock screen doesn't bother me in the slightest.

4,,,,"Great tablet! But heavier than expected. This is a great little tablet. Works well. Nice clarity. It's just a little heavier than I thought it would be. That sounds a little whiny, I know. But I have arthritis in my hands and it can be a bit hard to hold at times.",

0,,,Screen Came with scratchs on rhe screen,,
1,,,,"Good tablet , but improve the volume. This is a good buy but as a senior It is taking time to get used to . The screen is super sensitive. Just reaching towards it causes it to switch. I don’t like the activity and advertising for Amazon and Apps. I have it connected to Alexa so that is good. And also . The highest volume is to low. Do I need a speaker.  ??? Hope it will last more than 3 years. All the Samsungs died in 2yrs. 😇",
2,,,,,interacts poorly with the internet. great for using amazon features week in its interaction with google and other apps
3,,"Great for travel I have a 10' Nook tablet and it is a bit big for travel. I love this tablet because I fits in my purse so I don't have to carry a second carry on bag. I use it mostly for reading, as I subscribe to Kindle Unlimited.",,,
4,,,"Good For the Price At the time of this writing, this is the only tablet available in this price range. It's fine for what it does. I don't like that the battery is hardwired meaning that when it burns out, you can't replace it easily. Also, Amazon, in their infinite arrogance, defaults to an Internet homepage that is standard for their Silk browser and there is no mechanism to designate your own, preferred homepage. There is a way around this, but you should be allowed to set a homepage of one's own choosing. Also, Amazon does not provide users with Google Play Store where the vast majority of Android apps reside. Again, there is a way around this, but it's far, far more complicated than the workaround for the homepage issue.  Furthermore, since Fire runs the Amazon version of Android, there is no guarantee that Android apps from Google Play Store will work. Having said that, I have not run across  any such problems. I greatly preferred the versatility of the Barnes & Noble Nook, but they no longer produce a tablet in this price range, at least not right now. If you're on a budget like me, you're kind of stuck, but overall, if you can get past Amazon's hubris, it's not a bad tablet at all.",,
5,,,Very limited I’m disappointed with this device. It is sluggish to respond and has very limited features. I expected to have a decent selection of games to choose from in the App Store but it has nothing I’m remotely interested in. I would not purchase this item again.,,

9,,,,,"Not enough explanation of onscreen Icons. I will definitely have to call Amazon for instructions that didn't come with the Fire Tablet. Those explanations SHOULD have been included. I should have been able to take it out of its box and start using it. But that didn't happen. Yes, I'm disappointed. I didn't have this problem with either of my earlier Fire or Whisper Kindles. Amazon, PLEASE start including more CLEAR instructions for customers like myself who are not very tech-savvy! Thank you."

Since this is my first tablet all I can say is it's really good I mean, good battery charge (maybe a little slow to charge being a USB-C port), the cameras are not the best but it's good. It sounds very fairly, and the screen is good for me. Probably it's slow when your diving between different apps. I can't complain, I'm satisfied.",,,

The picture I’ve attached shows 31% charges, and still 16 hours left. This was taken after being plugged in all night! Not sure if Amazon has a warranty or exchange policy.

4,,Great Price Excellent product for the price.,,,
5,"Worst Amazon product/service I've ever experienced!!! Do not waste your money!!!! Do not buy this device!!!! Amazon really dropped the ball here... which is hard to believe!!! They have virtually never let me down before. The engineers at Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. The OS on this is so gross... I wouldn't use it as a paperweight. The amount of garbage Amazon apps that are on this device and their entire ecosystem for that matter is just sad and pathetic. I honestly would rather have a $10 no name Android tablet from ""Wish"" I am and will always be a loyal customer of Amazon but this was by far the most disappointed I've ever been in this company.",,,,
6,,,,A nice gadget to infuriate the wife. - I purchased my unit as a package deal with what I did not know was a coupon (never came) for a case through QVC when Amazon had their sale for just the unit itself.  Big mistake with QVC as their response was to return it and would not obtain the coupon for the case.  I'll now go to Ebay and get those little thinks necessary so if the unit falls it will not break or have a scratch screen.- This unit does not work well with my PHONAK hearing aides.  At one time it did then it did not...very annoying.- I do enjoy this unit as work out on my elliptical bike and use around the house.,

9,,,,,"If you're using Amazon only, then OK Unlike my other tablet this new Fire does not allow Libby or Adobe PDF reader. It also isn't very easy to read material offline.  Not real happy so far. Reading ebook kindle items works well, but other formats are a royal pain. I should have stuck with my other brand of tablet and used the kindle app. The Fire was cheap and now I know why."

I didn't like taking my computer to bed-seemed too much and I had to remember to take it with me in the morning.  So, there was a deal on this one.  The upgrades are nice, sound and pics are better.

The fire will accept memory chips , but thumb drives would be much more convenient. There is a defect in programing which prevents adding a second email. Only one of my devices would accept a second email. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with a tech tiring to install a second email even with his controlling my device remotely we were unable to get past a endless loop. The eight inch is fine for most uses. I use my ten inch only to play movies. The covers only add weight and do not stand by themselves.",

1,,,,"Good inexpensive tablet but not compatible with Google Play store Good points: Nice inexpensive tablet with a good screen and good battery life.Bad points: It's a little underpowered but ok for our needs.However, not being compatible with the Google Play store is a major flaw.  We purchased the tablet to use in a church setting so we need specific church apps.  Some of the apps are not on the Amazon App store and others are not the correct version.  Make sure the apps you need are on the Amazon App store before you purchase this tablet.  We got around the issues but it took a lot of time and effort.",
2,,"Love this tablet It works great , battery life is amazing.",,,
3,,good device Used mostly for reading. Works great,,,
4,,,Glitchy Can be a little glitchy. Like all of my other Amazon products. My echos both glitch a lot and so does the tablet. For the price point (got all on sale) all livable glitches not super impacting but sometimes a little annoying. Also the buttons on the side should be on the other side for right handed peeps.  When watch a movie I grab the tablet in its case stand and grab the power button based on hand placement locking the screen. SUPER annoying and can’t flip the stand case because of the camera. I don’t use as e reader because it strains my eyes. I like the paper white for that. Would recommend for minimal basic tablet use.,,

It's more for streaming videos and apps and reading... and less for photo editing/video editing for business promotion. But when I use Netflix, it works GREAT!

0,"Can't get the apps I need. I was hoping to use this tablet to travel, but cannot use it because the apps I need are not in the Amazon app store and the previous work arounds no longer work. Check the amazon app store first before buying! Probably give mine to a coworker since it is just a paperweight to me.",,,,
1,,,,,"Disappointed I bought this tablet after my Fire Tablet 10 stopped working and it was on sale at a very good price. I read reviews, outside of Amazon as well as Amazon, and it got good reviews. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to my previous Fire Tablet 10 but the battery life isn't near as good and definitely don't like the screen quality, my eyes feel stressed after usage. It also seems to open apps slower. And the Task Switcher takes 20 seconds to load. I guess maybe my expectations were too high but I am very disappointed."

Have taken every troubleshooting step suggested and it still doesn't function like it should. Also, the Vudu app is unavailable for this device, my iPad allowed all streaming that I used. It doesn't compare to the iPad, which I am sure is why the price difference is so big. I would spend the extra money for an iPad and save yourself the frustration.",,
6,,,,Just what I needed! I like the size weight and ease of use.,
7,"garbage,  slow and a terrible interface the best thing i can say about this generaton of the Kindle Fire is that it survived intact the two times i threw it across the room in fustration over how slow it is and how hard it is to access the book i wanted.  This device is the Amazon version of the Microsoft Vista operating system.  I've owned 3 prior models of the Fire and all were much better.  This one is absolutely awful",,,,

2,,,,,"Ambivalent Well, it's not terrible.  I have 2 very old kindle fires, before they had numbers and I love them.  But certain functions were being cut out or getting slow.  Zoom couldn't be updated and even Amazon shopping wasn't working properly.  So I got the Fire HD 8.  The best thing about it is I can do Zoom without having to go on my laptop.  And watching movies and TV shows in a slightly larger size than my old 7"" fires.But other things are annoying and there are glitches.  When reading books, it doesn't synch to the last page number I was reading in another kindle.  When i go back to my emails it doesn't return to the last place I had been reading.  The Amazon Fresh shopping doesn't work as well or i haven't figured it out yet.  The apps are nice, but it's made other functions more complicated.  It doesn't have simple Word or PDF applications or I have yet to figure out how to make them work.  And finally, it uses up the battery much faster it seems, and also seems to take longer to charge, although I admit I haven't timed it.I still mostly use my older kindles."
3,,Perfect Actually what I wanted,,,
4,,,Way to many ads for a kids tablet Dont like it to many ads you cant take off i dont want to take forever to do a simple task. And my kids does not need to see all of this either. I hate that stuff,,
5,,Good tablet for personal use I use this tablet for simple tasks and pleasure. I would recommend it if you’re looking for something easy to use. It’s 32 g so it wouldn’t be what you wanted if you have anything that requires a lot of storage although you can insert a memory chip.,,,

4,,Best Yet Image quality is wonderful as is sound. I have an echo show 5 and this one is a major step up. Screen size makes me wonder why anyone would want to go bigger since it doesn’t take up a huge amount of space on my night stand.,,,

Why 4 stars ? well, i hope im able to put a 5 stars later the thing is i just woke up and my son is still playing with it, as far as the specs, pretty pretty good. Would i buy it again ? Absolutely, just make sure that the SCREEN PROTECTOR comes before your tablet, if you are clumsy like me or as ""gentle"" (PUN INTENDED) as my kid... You need the screen protector first BEFORE the table. But as far as specs go. I'm a tech guy i'd give this product a 8/10",
9,,,,"Good for streaming I am happy with my Fire tablet. I wanted it mainly for streaming when in bed or away visiting family. It is perfect for this. The screen is a good size and has good picture quality. It is sometimes just a little difficult seeing parts of movies that are dark, but this isn't too big a problem. The battery life is very good. I do find it a bit slower to respond than other things like my phone but I do not consider this a huge issue. All in all it was a great deal on a tablet for streaming.",

1,,"Good case options are limited and Alexa is a BEAST I wish Fintie made the Tuatara Rotating Ring case for the Fire HD 8, 10th gen. If you want that awesome case you will need to get the Fire HD 10.I went with the Herize case because it offered the most features, but at a premium price, and it was easily modified for on-the-go plugs, but that hand-strap took a bit of work to remove. Still haven't figured out what they mean by 'Pen Holder' in the title.I really enjoy the Fire HD 8 tablets for writing.Because I'm authoring content I air-gap as much as possible, however; Alexa Communication services cannot be disabled on this version of the tablet.Alexa is aggressively pushed to control home devices now, with a dedicated on-screen control to manage devices.Even setting up the Parental Control will not weaken Alexa's grip on this tablet--thou shall not disable Alexa, or the communication services now.I have a 7th gen Fire HD 8. It's wonderful, paired with a Dragonborn K630 wired keyboard, using Writer+. I use an On-the-go adapter for wired peripherals, and I made sure to get a few usb-c on-the-go adapters for this tablet too. Using my wired keyboard, typing with this new tablet is wonderful, it's notably more responsive and the screen is great and the tablet sounds better too.",,,

1,,It works well as advertised  but it's not an Apple. I use it mostly for browsing the internet especially YouTube.,,,
2,It stopped charging after 1 year. I barely used my Fire tablet. It had a good picture and the charge lasted a long time. I had only charged it a handful of times over the course of the last year. Just after my warranty period was up it stopped charging and it tells me there is moisture in the charging port. I find this extremely hard to believe since this fire was always kept in a drawer and it actually charges until about 5% then it says there is moisture in the port. I would not buy another one.,,,,

I use it on my exercise bike and the handles don’t knock it off the stand like my fire tablet 10 inch does. This is very fast and we have weak Internet. Picture is beautiful and the sound is great.

Tried going to a website (like I always do on a PC) and it wanted me to DOWNLOAD A FRIGGING APP to view the webpage!!!!  It is NOT a browser in the conventional sense.(Background: I have been working with computers for over fifty frigging years).I put in a micro SD card with my music and videos ON it - it (the OS) gave me TWO options:  ""Erase"" or ""Format""  WTF?!?!?  Couldn't actually SEE my data.For me, this has been one sorry piece of equipment."
6,,,"2022 review - this is fine, but you get what you pay for. I got this on sale for $40 with a trade in deal for sending in my old 7"" fire (which was a hassle, btw - Amazon accepted it but then said it was defective, it definitely was not, then never sent it back despite me selecting the ""return items if rejected"" option. So they either lost it or reformatted it and sold it, hoping I wouldn't notice? Customer service did eventually give me a credit in Amazon gift cards, however).It's fine for the $40 I paid. Great for watching movies/show via the Prime app, Netflix, or even Plex. Note that some apps need to be side loaded via Google Play for a better experience imo.However, for my other two primary needs (reading ebooks and gaming) it's a mixed bag. The touch screen is poor (trying to type for a web browser is terrible, numbers and symbols require a 3+ second press with no option to change this in settings) so gaming is a struggle. I alleviate this somewhat with a Bluetooth controller however, as of late 2021 a Kindle Fire OS update stopped a key button (Menu, or Start button for old farts like me) from working in Game Pass. I've updated the controller firmware and searched Game Pass & Kindle forums, it's definitely an issue on the Fire side.Reading in the Kindle app is fine, but other apps aren't great. I use Hoopla for my local library ebooks and this screen cuts off 2-3 characters on the right side of the page, making it difficult to read sentences/paragraphs without the occasional guesswork.If you are looking to use this ONLY with the built in apps and apps within the Amazon/Kindle/Fire ecosystem, you'll probably be fine. But if you're like me and you like to do a little more, you will feel restricted. Still, for a budget android tablet, it's good enough.",,

Advertisements everywhere. Just not user friendly and it will get stuck on an ad screen or recipe and won't go back to the app I was using.My kids would rather fight over an old android phone I dug out of the drawer to watch video's on than use this.But I suppose I should praise it a little. If it's the only device available, the kids would rather play in their room and not watch it at all!"
9,,,,Nice upgrade I like my fire tablet the only thing I’m not crazy about and have not mastered is how to load my Libby (public library) function to the tablet to allow me to access the electronic library books I like to borrow.

There was no instruction booklet included. For someone new at tablets, it would have been nice to learn some tricks, shortcuts, and things to do. And some FAQs and troubleshooting!

I might just wait for the next generation."

But I only need it to read, and occasionally watch a downloaded movie on a plane. There were some disappointing changes from my older version to this new one besides size-- new charger needed (I needed an extra longer one) and my GooglePlay apps all disappeared when I transferred everything over. Apparently, you can't get them anymore on this model. But overall, it was a great buy and I'm satisfied.",
0,"Don't buy this item. I wanted to listen to music.  This was difficult to set up, the screen is too sensitive, and the information that Amazon wants to install is none of their business, like wanting access to my contact list, among other things.  I would not purchase this item again.",,,,
1,Won’t charge Ordered for my daughters birthday and it won’t charge past 10% now I have to return it and get a new one and deal with a angry 5 year old,,,,
2,,,,"Nice tablet! Great battery life, easy to use though doesn't always respond to touch if my hands are really dry. Fits in my purse or bag, charges quickly. Nice little tablet!",
3,,Good Great,,,
4,,"HD Fire 8"" I had a problem charging my 1st HD Fire 8 & Amazon finally send me a second piece to replace it. But by the time I received my 2nd HD Fire 8, my 1st tablet managed to work & get charged & so, I decided to resend the 2nd new piece back to Amazon. I did have another problem & its with the earplug. I was using my old kindle's earplug that finally did not work out. So I decided to drop by 4Star Amazon store & got a new piece. So far, all is working out well though I have not ventured to do much on my new HD 8 tablet. I must say I do like the new tablet and I'm enjoying it.",,,
5,,,,Kindle fire Not as friendly as my 8 generation tablet. Keeps resetting which is a pain.,
6,,,,Not able to download certain aps. Good for my magazine subscriptions and email.  The large screen makes watching TV and movies a pleasure. Use with games is a little more problematic.,
7,,"Great product, would buy another. Mostly used for reading however since receiving this newest fire I have used it to listen to music; order items and really enjoy using Alexa which I never used on my older fire.",,,
8,,"Using it more as e-reader I bought it, because I gave my 8 inch tablet to my wife and it is the perfect size for reading in bed.  Works great.  It's android, but with a Fire overlay.  I believe it sideloads apps, but I'm not sure.  Looks good.  Sound is decent.  Haven't tried the camera.  Battery life is great.",,,
9,,,,,Doesn't allow for easy access to other apps outside of Amazon School
0,,Loving my new kindle fire!! I’m loving it! I had the 7 inch but am enjoying the 8 much better and find myself using it more than my paperwhite. Picture quality is beautiful! I got it on sale and am so pleased I bought it!,,,
1,,Wow great tablet for the money This replaced a very old Apple mini that had an expired browser. I could not afford another apple ipad do I purchased the Amazon Fire Tablet. I am not disappointed at all!!!,,,
2,,No thanks No thanks,,,
3,"Only had it work 3 weeks. Was given to me as a gift. only worked 3 weeks. it is not the cord, no power at all. Do not have the receipt, as it was a gift. Loved it while it worked. Will purchase another tablet soon, probably not the same one.",,,,
4,,Nice I bought the fire at best buy but the case through Amazon. I love the case.,,,
5,,Great value Great product,,,
6,Weak Not enough power,,,,
7,"Too many adds Bought this for my four year old daughter, bc I do not want to give her an iPad quite yet.  She gets so frustrated with all of the ads!  I don’t allow her to use it a lot, but I would like to have some down time for myself.  I spend most of the time closing ads or dealing with her meltdown because of the consistent ads.  I like this is for kids specifically, but I shouldn’t have to pay for “ad free” content/games.",,,,
8,,,,Works good for what I'm using it for Works great with spacedesk app to extend a 3rd monitor to my virtual pinball machine.. the tablet is in the center of the pic between the speakers.. battery lasts all day. Cheaper than  a 3rd monitor,

Today, despite having been on a charger non-stop for 2 days the battery only charged to 62%. I really regret making this purchase and wouldn't waste my money.",,

9,"Stopped working within 90 days Amazon is really disappointing me with this product. Was purchased in November as a Christmas gift, returns are extended during this season, but warranties are not. So this item has been in the recipient’s hands for leas than 60 days and is just dead. Will not charge, or even boot/re-boot. I tried to chat with support, not available. I tried to use the “call me” feature and it makes you enter a pin. I entered the pin correctly two times, and the line replied “sorry, try again later” and hangs up.  Cool. I bought this item as a Christmas gift on a good sale, and to even replace it for the recipient, without support, I’d have to pay almost double the price I paid the first time. Not in a hurry to line Bezo’s pockets an more on this crappy product.",,,,
0,,"Great buy! Easy to use! Lots of useful apps !  Very entertaining, too.",,,
1,,"Fire 8 HD vs Fire 7, better for video. I have had three 7 fire tablets and the 8 HD makes for a better experience when watching video.  Using it for Kindle makes no difference to me and battery seems to last about the same as previous Fires for use with Kindle.",,,
2,,,,So far the Fire tablet is great The battery stays charged for a long time.  My only question is inBlue Light mode when reading a book the screen seems brighter than my old Fire.  Since I no longer have my old Fire I cannot compare.,
3,,Great tablet The tablet was great just not what I needed so I returned it,,,
4,,"Loving it! As with my previous tablets,  once I became accustomed to the differences, I was hooked! I am loving the quickness, clarity and length of battery life. All in all, it was a good buy.",,,
5,,,,"Almost an Android I liked the easy to read screen, albeit at it's low resolution.  However, detailed instructions are lacking --no manual, no comprehensive help function.  It feels like an android trapped in a Kindle jail.  Not being able to easily access Google Play severely limits the tablet.  I know how to side-load apps but it' s a pain and I'd rather not do it.  I use a Samsung S2 for work because it maximizes Android and all apps run on it.  This amazon tablet would be much more productive if it had full android access.",
6,,"Good resolution This was bought to replace my kindle 7.  I didn't want high end, just something to rrad on and it works perfect.",,,
7,,"Works well but... This is a 10th generation Fire tablet that my wife gave to me to replace my 6th gen Fire.  There are a few functional differences in the operation from the old one - some I like, others I don't -but I'll get used to it in time.  The only problem I really have with it - and the old one had the same problem - is that it thinks it is in Arizona while I am in Virginia.  Causes annoying problems with location sensitive apps.  Apparently this is a long-time problem for the Fire tablet that Amazon has never been able to solve.",,,
8,,Good Seller....!!!!! Very Fast,,,
9,,Very nice size tablet. I really like the size and the touch screen.,,,
0,,,Navigating Had difficulty at first navigating through the Tablet due to kids setting. It often would freeze. Also there was damage on the corner of the tablet when opened the box but the price was pretty decent for a child to watch  YouTube and play games on. Redone the child setting and was able to get other programs to download. The tablet it self is not a fast or speedy nor nifty as other tablets but it will do for now with the kiddos.,,
1,,Na Na,,,
2,,,,"So for the cost, the Fire tablet is great. It has a few glitches. The tablet is fair for the cost, a few glitches but overall, ok. I scream movies and read books on mine. It's not a tablet for creating documents-that feature is not very good.",
3,,Grrrrrrreat I absolutely love the eight it holds a charge for ever it’s easy to use quality of the picture is great I’m so glad I chose the eight. I had a seven because I wanted something small that would fit in my purse but it definitely lacked all the things I love about the act. You won’t be disappointed,,,
4,,"Works great!! Battery life is superb, touch screen is pristine, and screen looks fab!",,,
5,,"I like it! I read on this Fire most of the time. I also have watched some videos.It has a smaller frame than my previous one, and really needs a case to hold it better.Good battery life.",,,
6,,,,none no thank you,
7,,,,,Games are not automatically updated with your correct status I am disappointed with my new Fire 8. The update did not bring forward the current status of the games I play on a daily basis. I have not been able to locate some of the books I have purchased.  I followed the instructions as prompted on the screen to bring it up. This has been very frustrating since my old Fire does not always work properly but I have been forced to use it since the new Fire is not up to date.
8,,,,"The Screen Dims and Comes Back on Occasion This is my 3rd Kindle and I will buy another when this one dies.  The only issue I have noticed is that the screen dims and returns to normal light occasionally.  I notice it when I'm reading a book, not when I'm browsing.",
9,,I never knew I needed this in my life! Since my traveling has picked up I have used this so far for downloading movies  and books. I got tired of trying to read and watch everything of my phone. So far I love it!,,,
0,,,,,Bad Buy I have had multiple Kindle’s and loved them but this kindle is a flop. It shuts off whenever it wants. The only way to turn it back on is to plug it. Battery says it’s fully charged and still has to be plugged back in. Once you plug it in it reboots itself and 9 out of 10 times you have lost whatever you had on it. Called Amazon support they did try to be helpful and actually sent a new one only for it to do the same thing and now it has started to shut off while plugged in.
1,,"Meets all my expectations especially for the price I wanted something with larger print than my telephone, since I have glaucoma. I use mainly for Facebook and games. My telephone is old, so I use my fire to save using my telephone. Great Price",,,

8,,,"Not useful for this senior citizen I was pleased at how easy it was to set up BUT I was unable to use it for AOL mail, shopping on Ebay or to do banking with Chase.  To use as a reader I ( already have an old Kindle which still works) or watch movies etc I'm sure it would be fine but that's not why I got it.  I returned it. I was remiss in not doing research before I ordered it.  I  wasted time on ordering it.  Still waiting on refund.",,
9,,"I love it! I honestly use this tablet to read books on and seldom use it for basic internet browsing.

It's a great affordable option with decent speakers and battery life as well.",,,

5,,"Important improvements I've always felt the Fire is a great deal and this will be my 3rd version (in addition to my couple of kindles). The only things that I began to feel needed improvement on my old one was the relatively short battery life, the slow speed when operating on wi-fi and the lower screen quality. This seems to have taken care of all those problems and I upgraded to a bit more memory so should hold me for awhile! Nice machine!",,,

This device worked well for 2 months after that it started shutting down automatically and my Amazon Music app doesn't work.  When I contacted customer service regarding this issue, I was told to delete the app and I have to re-purchase all songs that have been downloaded.  So, I would basically describe this device as ""trash"" and I do not recommend that anyone purchase this whether directly from Amazon or any other electronics store (Best Buy, etc.).",,,,

0,,,,"It works great so far. The only issue we're having is, once we put Amazon Kids on it, it's taken over the whole system. Trying to get out of it was fine, once we figured out how, but then it takes over when you try to install anything, even when in parent mode. It's causing a fairly sizeable issue. I was told and found online that I should be able to install ABCMouse, but, so far, no go. This was the only reason we updated the tablet.",

I have followed the instructions provided by Amazon for correcting the issue (clearing cache, force stopping, factory resetting, etc.), but they (Amazon) say they are still working on the issues.  I have the Alexa app on my Samsung A71 5G phone and the app works much better on my phone.

I sure hope that improves soon as I use it every day for reading,  Very seldom do I ever use it as a tablet but wanted the capability (just like with the first versions)  in case of travel when I don't want to carry a laptop along (like overseas).  In an effort to give me everything I could ever imagine wanting, all the choices do is make it harder to get to what I DO want to see.  If I want to use the Kindle feature, close all the other features.  If I want to use the internet browser, let me open that browser at that time.  Sometimes more is not better.

However, after some sleuthing and clever internet-ing, I discovered that the Fire can be, um, enhanced, if you know what you’re doing. Throw in an extra microSD and you have a capable e-book, audiobook, and comic reader. Bluetooth works great. Not all Google Play apps work, but you can usually find something useable.

Kid friendly videos and games too if your kids are into that. Mine weren't until they got this and just love to explore all the new things on it for them to do. Alexa doesn't seem to be working as I planned she would, maybe thats operator error on my part I'm not sure because the tablet would stay locked too and need a pass code to unlock that I thought I set up to keep the kiddos out of my account and other adult content but it instead locked my kids out of the tablet altogether. So now I somehow disabled the pass code but Alexa won't work now for the kids, I taught them how to call family members whenever and in case of an emergency by using Alexa but that isn't working now??? I'm frustrated and have given up trying to figure it out lol I at least got a great deal on this from QVC a couple months before christmas. I bought 2 of the 64GB, 1 went to my parents as well, they love it too! I would have liked to have gotten a screen protector with my bundle though rather than some other stuff that was included.

3,"You Get What You Pay For.... Bought two tablets for our kids and found the entire Fire OS, app store and overall experience to be needlessly complex and loaded with friction.  Apps rarely work as well as they do on other platforms (iOS, Android, etc.). Continually logging in, rebooting, restarting apps such as YouTube Kids, Roblox and Minecraft.  My wife and I frequently quip to one another, ""I wish we had never gotten these tablets"".  My recommendation is to save the frustration, spend the extra money and get the iPad....",,,,

3,,,,,Does not mirror books. Sadly for some unknown reason Amazon Kindle/Fire decided to not continue the mirror feature for books (or anything else has there is no mirror feature offered on the display tab of the fire tablet) with their newer kindles. I am sure that when whoever made this decision has an elderly family member that they are taking care of THIS WILL change. Unfortunately until that happens there is no readily simple way for someone with declining eyesight to read the books that they have already purchased on their kindle. I am attempting to enable my mom to be able to read again (has been a more than an avid reader her entire life and macular degeneration and old age have made this nearly impossible. If the type is big enough such as mirroring the books to a large screen smart tv she can still read). I do not think that anyone from Amazon will actually read this feedback so for the time being nothing will change. Am returning both the fire stick and the Amazon Fire tablet.

1,,"Everyone should have one, but ... I am a fan. I have a 5th gen Fire 7. Bought 10th gen Fire HD 8. The 7 was a little slow, and still running v5 o/s.The 8 is fast ENOUGH, and responsive ENOUGH.Great for word games, lite browsing, Prime music, Prime video, and Prime shopping!Screen control is good for reading ... You can set the blind to sepia or green, and there is a full complement of font setup choices.It is an Amazon consumption machine, not a laptop replacement!No apps for Zillow or Kasa or webmail. No alternative browser, tho Silk is ok. No Audacy, but TuneIn is there. No mainstream text, but you can use Skype. Does anyone use Skype in the USA?There's plenty of tv ... Peacock, Pluto, CBS, Paramount, generally a full suite of tv. I guess Jeff had to cave here, in order to sell Fire STICK.Spotify and Pandora are available too!So, bottom line is that it WORKS and the price is low (especially when on sale).Given the price, I won't have anxiety about taking it to the park or stuffing it in a backpack. And it's small enough to go anywhere.Speakers are good ENOUGH, and you can hook into headphones jack or Bluetooth.Cool factor, if you like Alexa, this device is a hands free echo, even if not in show mode. Don't want hands free Alexa, you can turn it off.Screen is good. Touch is good. Memory is lite. Processor is adequate. Apps are limited. I'm not giving up my Surface Pro, but I definitely recommend the Fire HD8 for what it is.",,,
2,,,Battery and start up time I replaced my 13 year old kindle that would keep a charge for weeks to this new kindle. I find the battery life to be much shorter and the start up time much longer. I also don’t like the turn on/off Wi-Fi feature as it doesn’t stay in view but just pops off the screen and is difficult to switch on/off. It’s not as user friendly.,,

8,"Total POS My sole purpose in owning a Kindle is to have my newspaper subscriptions downloaded each morning so that I can take the Kindle with me when I leave each morning and browse them as time permits throughout the day. My last two or three Kindles have been hopelessly inconsistent in downloading my subscriptions. They are almost never fully downloaded and I have to spend precious time fiddling to get them on the device. If the days papers do show on the home screen they are most often not actually downloaded, I have to tap each one and wait for it to download, which is frequently excruciatingly slow. Many days I have to sync the device, which can take even longer and it's not uncommon to have to obtain the papers by going through my account menu, which takes even longer. I can literally walk down to my corner store and buy a copy of the paper in less time that I spend getting it on the Kindle.This is total BS. I remember my very first Kindle was a revelation. It connected directly to a cell phone signal and on more than one occasion found a signal and downloaded my paper when I was out camping in the forest.

No matter what application you watch from. It starts off in sync and then the screen twitches and then everything goes for broke. I talked to customer service and finally got to a technician and we got dirty with details and it still hasn't been fixed. It's been 4 years and these all have the same operating system every fire tablets. So that means none of them work and I can't believe nobody has complained or mentioned this!! I am tired of doing their work for them and sitting on the phone and getting frustrated and messing with my emotions because of their lack of American love and to sell products that actually work as advertised!!! Before the return window closed, I wanted to figure this out because this would be a good tablet for the battery and the USB-C and especially they had phones if they actually worked properly, this would be the best tablet on the market unbeatable untouchable, but it's a knock off of itself... I asked for them to send me a plus because that has a better processor and maybe that would have fixed the problem, but their option is telling me to return it and rebuy it when I got it on sale and it's like triple the price. So you want me to return the tablet that doesn't work that you false advertise me on in the reason why I bought it and you want me to return it so I can purchase another one that's not on sale that's three times the price just to see if that works properly? Ummm no!!! You just lost yourself a customer. I'm a genius and I love to fix things and I was trying to help you guys out and I wasted enough time with you. I'm appalled at your option for helping fix this issue that solely relies on your false advertisements... I would rather get a handy j from Freddy Krueger, then to ever ever ever ever waste my time with an Amazon product if this is how they stand behind them...If you plan on using the Bluetooth 5.0 and LDAC, do not get this tablet. It doesn't do anything except videos. Everything else, it's not powerful enough to do. Not even barely surf the web. They could have only fixed this, this would be the number one tablet on the market simply for what it's actually for, to enjoy videos and quietly without disturbing people around you and without being disturbed yourself....All fire HD tablets are a fail!!! I appreciate you guys wasting all of the time you have made me waste for absolutely nothing... I won't be giving you guys any more free education.... Please move on with this and go buy something else unless you just want it for video and external speakers, then this is your tablet. I really wish they could have worked with me, cuz this had potential, but either way, hopefully this helps if you're in the market for the headphones and tablets",,,,

I do wish Amazon would be upfront in their advertising regarding the fact that bookmarks, highlights, and notes in books do not transfer.  Also, game progress cannot be transferred from another Kindle device. Many games require an investment of money, and all of that is lost.  Needless to say, I will not be playing any games on this device.  Now I understand why people are ditching their Kindles for paperback books--to lose all of your notes and highlights is bad business practice.  I don't know what you were thinking Amazon, but this decision leaves no incentive to purchase ebooks or invest in Kindle unlimited.  I had thought about purchasing a new Kindle reader this year, but not now.  In addition, I would be wary of using any writing apps, photo apps, file apps--anything that creates something one might want to save and have access to in the future.

I thought it was my outlets so I kept plugging it in, waiting to see if it would charge and then changing outlets. Returned the next day. Second HD was doing well until it wasn't. About 72 hours before the end of my return window, the same thing happened. I charged it over night. Woke up and it was still at 41%. Went back to BestBuy to replace that one. And now I have my 3rd and FINAL one. There will not be a replacement #4. I will simply move on to another company. Other than the charging issue I do enjoy my Fire. I don't use is as a tablet.

7,,,,,"Just okay I really hate the app options. I hope that Amazon revamps their App Store offerings. There are very, very limited options for downloading apps. If I wanted to use this on an airplane I’d have to download movies/shows in order to watch on the plane with no WiFi. If the plane has wi fi I can use the airlines app and watch movies, but you can’t get the airlines apps in this. Also I put Google Play Store on it and it seemed to have slowed it way down so I reset it to factory settings. It moves smoothly when watching shows, movies, or listening to music, but can’t really handle games seamlessly. I’d say if you want your tablet to be able to handle heavier apps like games get the Fire 10 because it has an Octa Core processor. As far as the App Store goes I’d return this on those grounds alone. Yes they’re affordable, but there are major improvements needed!"

To install the Google Play Store I searched the internet and found lots of websites that show you how to down load the needed APK files. It took me roughly a 1/2 hour to research, download, and install the files. Now I have access to the Amazon App Store and the Google Play Store so now I'm happy.Good little tablet for my internet searching needs while watching tv.

2,"Confusing and Useless for Me I received my Kindle Fire 8 on Feb 6 and I'm returning it today, the 8th. I bought it because my Kindle Paperwhite can only read out loud with Bluetooth earphones or the car which works sometimes. The Fire 8 can use regular earphones so I bought it.  The many downsides of this Kindle 8 far exceeds the minor irritation that Bluetooth earphones cause me. So, yesterday I was trying to read a Kindle text to speech book on my new Kindle. I would get it to start reading but if the Kindle is tilted slightly it tells you that it's repositioning the screen, which makes it stop reading so you have to start all over with trying to get it to read. I turned off the repositioning screen option. At some point I touched the screen and brought the book to chapter 49 when I was reading page 11. It took a while to figure out how to get back to the beginning. Then I was listening for few minutes and, poof, the book goes into lock screen. So I would have to start over. I find there is no way to turn off lock screen and the longest you can set it is 30 minutes. A lot can happen in that 30 minutes, such as my Kindle realized that it can't connect to WIFI. I'm in my car so no, it can't connect to WIFI but it likes to remind me every few minutes, which turns the reader off and I have to start over. But I was driving so I had to wait until I got home. My internet was down when I got home so my kindle couldn't connect to WIFI still. It had to remind me. I was going to listen to my story until I fell asleep so I turned the WIFI off in options and turned reader back on. 30 minutes later, poof, it went to lock screen. I was done. It's going back today. It does not in any way add to my enjoyment of reading. I still don't know what a ""waypoint"" is but it tells me I have four or more on my book screen, covering some of the text. I do wish Amazon would bring back the original Kindle text to speech reader.",,,,
3,,,,,Hard to use. I bought it to play games on and it is difficult to use also it is limited to Amazon games I can't download games from Google play.

Great battery life, touch screen was responsive, didn't have tons of memory but worked quickly when navigating around different websites. I could download multiple formats of books with no problem. Unfortunately the screen was stepped on and it was cheaper to buy a new one, which led to me purchasing the Fire HD 8. This new fire takes a minimum of 7 seconds to load any webpage when connected to wifi (have tried different wifis), and the only book formats I don't have a problem with are epubs. Can no longer access mobis at all. The screen quality is terrible so not a good option for watching shows or playing games either. It is heavy, no way to hold it easily with one hand, which was never a problem with my other fire. Basically it is clunky and slow. The frustration you will feel from using this is not worth the small moments of pleasure you might experience.",,,,

I purchased the ad supported option due to the significant difference in price and after using would have returned it if I'd paid full price. I do not recommend paying the full price, as the ads really do not make a difference. The ads are brief and they do not disrupt anything. You just watch them when you unlock the screen. That said the tablet's audio is not very good; thankfully I already had external Bluetooth speakers. The picture and playback are decent enough but the other features are not great. The Alexa does not work very well with this tablet nor do voice commands in general. Since it's an Amazon product there are far fewer apps available than there would be with a non-Amazon device. That said, what I wanted was the cheapest tablet that I could buy new that could stream shows and play music, which this device can. In that sense I got exactly what I paid for.",,

I was tired of using my phone for my entertainment mostly for painting.

I have had an excellent experience with Samsung electronics and should probably have spent the extra money to buy one in the first place.

First Alexa would come on and you were stuck with it on screen.  Couldn't get it to shut down.  Had to reboot.  Then the back button at the bottom of the screen disappeared so what ever app you went to you were stuck there.  The only way to change apps is to reboot in between every single thing you try to do.  Appears this is an ongoing problem with the Fire HD8 since you can fine numerous complaints and pleas online on how to fix this.  Some claim Amazon is working on a solution.  I've been dealing with this problem for well over a year so I'm not buying that excuse.  The only way, apparently, to correct the problem is to reset the device which wipes it clean of all stored data.  Pretty sh*tty way to fix this glitch in my book.

A very heavy caveat nonetheless: Amazon pointlessly belabors and punishes their consumers with the petty politics with Google. Ergo, Google Play Store is not available on purchase. It can be easily side loaded.  Also, the android version is strangely ""incompatible"" with many useful apps. So, it is not a fully functioning android tablet. The tablet is designed to be used as is, and the ""non-techy"" consumer is shackled to a limited selection of Amazon Apps, which again, is not a bad deal for the price.  Just be aware that Amazon is offering a tablet with an ""adjusted"" android operating system.  If you want a grab and go kind of thing, you'll love it.",,

1,,,,Buena compra Buen regalo,
2,,A convenient repacement for my old ipad that no longer received updates. Exellent for reading ebooks from library.,,,
3,,,,Wish it had a hand grip or a flip stand...very hard to hold! Charges fast.  Good battery life. Nice screen for video but not easy for reading text. Very slippery n hard to hold. This should have a grip or a stand built in and come with a case.,
4,,A new experience A new experience with the tablet adds to my every day enjoyment and information gathering.,,,
5,,"This is a Amazon tablet it is an Amazon operating system and only will run apps it deems safe. I bought my tablet for $58.00 dollars and it was a steal.  I don't find any of the limitations difficult to deal with especially considering the security.  I have no problems and consider it an excellent tablet.  It is fast the touch screen is excellent in my view.  It has expandability and as always lives up to Amazons standards. The 10 inch format is very nice, a beautiful screen.  I have had several Amazon tablets and they have always been more than advertised.  It may be tied into Amazon but the price you pay is worth it.  There are many things worse when buying a tablet than being associated with Amazon.  The Kindle features alone are worth the price.",,,
6,"DEFECTIVE! I keep this model in one place on a desk unless using.  After a couple of months it gave me a message when trying to charge that there was moisture in the charging port and it would not charge.  IT HAS NEVER BEEN NEAR MOISTURE.  I called support and they instructed me how to reset and the issue went away for a time.  Well the issue came back and the unit is at 6% and very soon won't be able to turn on at all.  Support won't do anything about my being sent a faulty product because it only had a 30 day warranty.  I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE SENDING ""NEW"" MERCHANDISE.",,,,

 This is the 3rd Fire HD tablet that I've had.  I'm reaching the conclusion that this technology is subpar for my use and expectations.This brand new device decides today to NOT restart upon command.  It just loops in a circle for about 40 minutes.  Then it powers down and comes back up with an alert that my 32gb microSD card is incompatible.  It's only been IN the tablet and working since I took delivery on December 12th.These are not reliable, quality-made tablets!"

The battery on the first one just died completely a few months ago, rendering it completely unusable.  The battery life on the second is getting shorter and has to be charged more frequently.  The screen quality on both is good and the touch screen is fine.  I just ordered and received my third Kindle.  I haven’t used it much, other than reading books on it, but I expect it to operate much like the second one.",,,

I use a music app and had to install three different apps to be able to load the music. Now I have to figure out how to tansfer my ablums from my phone to the tablet. I tried hooking up the phone an tablet but that didn't work. I saw that you can transfer your music to the cloud and then to your table. I did email myself and download from there but to labor intensive. It is a very nice tablet though, not too large, fits in a stand and I am hoping to get my music on the tablet soon.",

0,,Great for basic things Great fun loving downloading books and apps in one place,,,
1,,,,Really good buy New 2021 model has nice screen resolution and nice processor. Happy with my purchase.,
2,,,"Not much improvement from 2017 model. Too many bad design changes. I've had my 2017 model for several years now and liked it. So I decided to upgrade when I saw that there were deals on the 2020 version. I'm not so sure it was worth it. I currently own both of them and have had ample opportunity to compare them side by side. After several days of frustration have decided to vent my opinion in my review.The new one has more memory to load apps and has a slightly faster processor so things run a little smoother. Those are good things, but there are many design changes which are not so nice.The old one has the camera on the portrait side making it a little narrower and easier to handle, almost like holding a large phone, which is very nice for reading online books. The new one has the camera on the landscape side so the tablet is wider and unwieldy. You can't really figure out how to grip it and are almost forced to use a stand.The screens have the same pixels but the 2020 version is darker and won't get as bright as the old one.The 2017 sound quality was never great but the 2020 sound is even worse. It won't get as loud and sounds muffled, not nearly as crisp as the old one sounded.However the most annoying thing to me are the power and volume buttons. On the 2017 model they projected out a nice distance so they were easy to feel, were silver colored so they were easy to see, and were spaced far apart so they were easy to find and not confuse between volume and power. On the 2020 version these buttons are reduced in height so you can't feel them, are now colored black so you can't see them, and are shoved closer together so you are not sure if you are on volume or power. You actually have to turn the tablet edge toward you to look at it so you can see which button you are pushing. This was clearly a design change for style with very little thought for functionality. To make it even worse the volume buttons have been programmed to switch position depending on the orientation of the tablet. If you are in landscape mode the top right button will be volume up. But if you turn the tablet to portrait mode the very same button becomes volume down! How silly is that? You never really know which way you are turning the volume until you see the volume tray pop up on the screen!If this is your first tablet then this is not a bad one for the money. But if you are contemplating an upgrade move I would say that the annoyances outweigh the benefits. If Old Faithful is working fine I would say to forget about switching and just keep it.",,
3,,,Disappointed I have never had a problem with the fire tablets before but with this one I never got to even get it to work.,,

The Fire 8 got my attention. I watched a several reviews online and decided on the Fire 8.All of the reviews I watched gave the tablet an overall positive rating. The only con came from those reviewers that were into ""heavy gaming."" That con did not apply to me because I am not a ""gamer.""I use mine to play game that are available free for the Amazon store. And, I use this tablet to watch You Tube videos instead of my lap top computer. For my purposes, this was an excellent choice. I am glad I went with the Fire 8. It is the perfect size for me.",,,

3,This tablet is unreliable as it times out randomly. Will never buy another one. Times out randomly and is slow to get going again.,,,,
4,"Excruciatingly  slow This has to be the slowest tablet I have ever owned . I have an 8 year old Samsung tablet that receives no updates, because it's so old and it's faster than this tablet. I'm not sure if they sent me a lemon, but if this is how these work, then this the worst tablet in the world.  I have added 3 apps. and I can't run , I can't even run Amazon apps on them. Even just unlocking the screen takes a couple of seconds. To click the navigation buttons, it takes 2-3 touches until they respond.The the display unit android tablet I played around in Walmart, which costs $45 is about 10x faster than this tablet. To flip the screen as I rotate , it takes 5 seconds, until it notices that I am holding the tablet in landscape.  Is Amazon selling counterfeit Amazon tablets or what?",,,,
5,,Great for kids Easy to use for kids.,,,
6,,,,"Price vs product = YES!!! Great gift for myself and others.  the price couldnt be beat.  all features of the product are very nice including the free book readings.  I initially had no trouble in connecting wi-fi... probably the first month.  It seems that once its been ""broken in"", the device has difficulty finding wi fi's and connecting.  I have no way of knowing how to change settings either.  All i can say is that when i first started using the tablet, it was effortless.  Now i'm forcing it to connect to wi fi since it has difficulty doing so on its own now.  its a great product when i am home. only other thing is regardless of changing the settings, you cant get rid of the game offers when you open up the tablet.  when i open it, i want to go straight to what i want.  not have to swipe away game offers.",
7,,,,,"Ads ads ads Device works fine, but there are so many ads and they say that you agree to seeing them during purchase and set up, so if you want to remove them you have to pay a fee.

So cheesy.I wish the screen had a sharper resolution.It's slow.I like reading books on it and its a good size to watch videos.",,
2,,I was able to take a 100 question test with ease. Screen quality great and font adjustable for my eyes.  Battery lasted long enough for a 3 hour test.  Touch screen always great,,,

8,"Terrible product, not even worth the low price I cannot stress enough how much I wouldn't recommend this purchase. It may seem appealing given the low price for a decent sized tablet, but it has a myriad of issues and works so poorly I get stressed out every time I use it.First, there is nearly zero support for this tablet. Almost no standard apple/android apps are available, even ones that should be a bare-minimum. Of the ones that *are* available, at least 75% of them just link you to the browser-based version of the app rather than a standalone app, and these rarely even work on amazon tablets (i.e. Discord, YouTube, etc).Second, even the base-level functionality of the tablet is filled with glitches. You may not get a notification from any of your social media for months, then all of a sudden have 100+ notifications pop up at once at an indeterminate amount of time in the future. The software is also very laggy and I've had terrible connection issues that I'm certain aren't due to my internet provider (Google Fiber), and have troubleshooted otherwise.Third, the tablet is riddled with ads. The entire lock screen is littered with so many that it is just plain obnoxious. Given the price, I could deal with this if the other issues weren't there, but as it stands it is unacceptable.The only time I ever use this tablet is when I have literally no other devices to use at the time, and I still walk away frustrated from using it for as little as 30 minutes. I would not recommend it at all.EDIT: Forgot to mention one of the worst features. Even with the tablet at 100% battery before completely shutting it off for the night, it will still somehow be dead by the morning. Makes me wonder what kind of apps they are running in the background even with it shut off.",,,,
9,,Good experience This is my first ever tablet. I am enjoying it. It's taking me time to learn how to maneuver threw the platform. It retains a charge for a long time. I also like the fact that it is on the heavier side. I find that I'm less likely to drop a device that has some weight to it. I recommend this device.,,,

To be clear, the unit came charged but would not charge upon n running down and needing the first charge. I finally got it to work by turning off and restarting. I will see if that is needed on each charging but if that is the case I will return it while it is on warranty.",,

1,,Great battery life Great battery life,,,
2,"Slow performance and outdated charging This still uses a slow charging, 5 watts I believe so it takes forever to charge. For no good reason.As far as the slow performance its not surprising considering the only 2GB of RAM but I bet it'd be better off if we were actually able to get rid of the 10GB of bloating software that it comes with.The Ads and constant amazon content being shoved upon you is insane. I bought the no ad version and you guys just cannot provide a product without forcing ads and Amazon content down the users throat.And don't forget you can indeed install Google Play Store and thus whatever apps you want, just look it up online. Its really not that bad to do.In the end its useful as a reader and utilities. Frustratingly slow for browsing the web or watching videos. Also the positioning of the buttons and speakers (as well as quality) are questionable.",,,,

3,,,,Nice Would have like a short written guide to get started.,
4,,Great item Battery lasts forever. Completely pleased.,,,
5,Not a great gift to get Amazon's limited app selection and proprietary programs aren't the best choices. What I found really damning is that the lock screen has ads and some of them are inappropriate for smaller children. They want you to pay an additional $15.00 to turn it off. Just buy a different tablet,,,,

Must Have!",,,
3,,Easy to manuver. Even my husband can use it!,,,
4,Very very limited regarding apps you can download This tablet does not let you down load all the apps available for android.  Amazon limits what apps you can use.  It's really a platform for Kindle and other Amazon products,,,,

0,,,"Good little tablet. I got this when it was 45 bucks, I wouldn't spend anymore on it. It's got ads but you can disable them with fire toolbox. Launcher is awful, Amazon appstore is awful, but that's what modding is for. If you don't know how to mod, and this is listed for more than 50 bucks for you, look elsewhere. Otherwise in my case it's pretty good. After getting Google services, removing Amazon bloat, and disabling lockscreen ads, it's okay. Calling this HD is like calling lead nontoxic. It might fit the standard but at this size the pixels are massive lol. Build quality is nice tbh. I don't mind the plastic, it makes it lighter and more durable than metal or glass. It's pretty slow but it's fast enough to stream HD video. Games like terraria struggle heavily, and I shutter to imagine something like cod mobile on this thing. It fits a really specific use case, kids and people who want to watch video in bed on a slightly larger screen than their phone. If that's you, get it. Otherwise if you can shell out a little more for something with a good appstore pre-installed and specs not from 2013 I would.",,

I just got my new Fire 8"" and only had for two weeks and more than a handful of times I have gone to open the cover and have a black screen and then I hit the power button on top and the screen is still black! It is charged over 65% and a few times even in the 90% range of charged and the ONLY way it will go back on is if I plug it into the power code and hit the power button and then the screen with go on to the fire logo and then reset to my screen.  I called and was told Amazon has never heard of this problem and I know that is not true based on other support comments made.  I had to fight to ask for it to be replaced and then get an email being told that I have only days to return my faulty one or I will be fully charged for a replacement that is not scheduled to be delivered to me for 2 months!!!  So what? Amazon expects me to have NOTHING to use for 3months??? Even though I have paid fully for their product?!?!  Unacceptable!  Amazon Fire needs to fix this software problem and own up to it honestly! I should continue to be able to use my faulty Fire THAT I PAID FOR until my replacement comes and then send it back!",,,,

3,,,,Size Everything,
4,,"Nice Size I put off purchasing a Kindle because I was not sure I would like reading from a tablet.  Then, my daughter bought me this tablet for Christmas.  Am now a convert to reading on the Kindle.  It is just the right size to hold while in a chair or sitting in bed reading.  Love that the ""page"" turns with just a tap of my finger.  And one of the best things is you can close it, go do something else for a few minutes and  when you re-open it is on the same page.  So, no need for a bookmark to hold your place. (which when reading in bed and you fall asleep is a big plus)  Have not really used this tablet for much of anything else yet but it will be great to take with me the next time I travel since it also gets the internet.  If you are an avid reader and have not tried this, you should try it out.",,,
5,,Good replacement for my old gen 1 Fire The old Fire finally bit the dust.  This is a nice replacement and upgrade.  Being able to access the google app store would make this a better value.,,,
6,"Sorry; but, this tablet is trash. No gps, no good games (or games I play), if you try to take pictures or video; the quality is terrible, can’t even mirror my iPhone. The only thing I use it for is to trade (stocks) and watch YouTube videos (really don’t need it). Give me a piece of equipment that I feel like I NEED. I guess you get what you pay for.🤷🏽‍♂️",,,,

9,,,"Like the device but not the trade-in program! I upgraded to this Kindle 8 several months ago--taking advantage of Amazon's trade-in discount. While I am very satisfied with the device--speed, size, screen clarity--I had a terrible experience with the trade-in process. Though UPS tracking showed that my trade in was received by Amazon well in advance of the deadline, I was notified several weeks later that my trade in was cancelled, and the anticipated value was charged to me. Now I'm out both the trade-in value as well as my old device--which apparently Amazon has lost! Calls and contacts to customer service have been very frustrating with no clear answers. Had I known this, I would have just kept my old device rather than going through this annoying process!",,

2,,,,,"Never again Never will I buy a Fire again. This is my 3rd one. Each one had a different problem., and didn’t last as long as it should have. The first one had a problem, found out (after it had stoped working) Amazon was aware, but mine didn’t present the problem until the time frame to replace was over, I was never informed that the problem existed! The second one just stoped charging!The one I just bought 4 months ago, has this glitz. I only use the tablet to read. Not to surf the internet or to play games, just to read.  I’m an Amazon Prime member, so  when I travel I have one dedicated device, that fits nicely into my purse or backpack. But it’s freaking annoying. I have to troubleshoot how to go from the book, to the bookstore, I.e. tun it off, turn it back on, go to “home”, go to library, power it completely off.  I like the Fire, when it’s working correctly.  I bought a warranty (I learned my lesson) I had hoped this was a fluke, and it was an “operator” problem. But I know how to operate the device. I thought it was the program, but it works fine on my Apple phone. Unfortunately, I’ll have to send it back under the warranty. This is the last Fire I will own, 3 strikes. ."
3,Good while it lasted Got for my 5 year old. Lasted 14 months and now it’s “bricked” and won’t boot up. Kept in a protective case with screen protector.I’d recommend spending the extra money and just buying an iPad. The Fire is good but it just didn’t last. Ya get what you pay for!,,,,

0,Not what I expected I bought this tablet for my daughter. It’s the worse tablet I ever held in my hand. It’s just so plain and you have to download apps that usually are already installed on devices. It does what it’s intended to do but as a comparison to other tablets this one is not one for me. I’m a mom always on the go. If you’re use to android and/or apple products good luck with figuring out how to use this on the go.,,,,

There was a bit of confusion with the upgrade process, but customer service worked to iron things out, so that I finally got my 20% discount and had my new tablet in my hands.So far, though I've only had the new Fire tablet for a little over a week, I've been very pleased. I love having more space than the older version. It is fast, and responsive. It seems to charge quickly and (so far, though of course it's new) hold a charge well. I'm very pleased with the tablet itself.My only complaint? Within days of my receiving my new tablet, Amazon appears to have lowered the price by about $40. I really wish someone could have let me know there was about to be a huge price drop. I'd have waited another week to purchase it!Still, it's a good tablet, and if you buy it now you're getting a much better deal than I did!",,,

5,,,,,Power issues I am returning the product for a new one.  This one will be charged but will not turn on sometimes without the power cord plugged into it.  It works fine 2-3 times then has to have the power cord to turn on.  Battery is charged.  Worked with Amazon to see if it was a glitch or what but they could not explain or help so they are replacing.

9,,,,"Nice unit but battery is iffy at best This is my second kindle, the first was a 6” and without being plugged in I couldn’t get more than 1 1/2 hours of read time.  My wife bought a new 8” at the end of December 2021 and has already had to have it replaced because it wouldn’t charge more than33%, hats off to Amazon, they agreed to replace it, no charge. So the jury is still out on mine. But so I like it very much.",

6,,,,Does what a tablet needs to do I was gifted this for Christmas. Didn’t really need it but have used it for watching tv in bed when I don’t want to sit up and watch it. Camera quality is horrible but that’s why we have phones right?,

Why can they use the phone tec to skip logging on to wifi? I can not even talk to Amazon on the device . I am also blocked by them on feedback!",,,,

8,,Great buy My kid loves her tablet she is very happy n iam as well,,,
9,,,"Battery life is bad and charging issues on both tablets I purchased I think it's a good item for kids, it's affordable and good for the price. However first week we experienced issues with the 2 exact same tablets we bought. The charging port is defective, or something along those lines. I had to return and order a replacement for one and now have to do the same for the other one. So bought two new tablets, needing to return and get two new ones when they were brand new. I'm disappointed and wouldn't likely buy another fire tablet in the future, after these ones go out. However for the price, if charging port works OK, then they are good for young kids for the price.",,
